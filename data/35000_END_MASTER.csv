As a result, protecting critical information and its availability is now a strategic business imperative. Encryption is the most pervasive technology employed today for protecting data. In fact, while encryption was once used almost exclusively to protect information using symmetric and asymmetric keys to scramble data, now it is also used in authentication mechanisms to confirm the identity of a user or a device, and for digital signing to ensure the integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation of data.</p>
<p>The new mandates regulatory bodies are layering on firms requiring that they secure specific types and classes of data are causing an upsurge in the use of encryption. For example, nearly half of US States have passed laws forcing companies to notify individuals whenever certain types of unencrypted customer data are lost or stolen. Organizations that have had to report such breaches, have seen substantial deterioration of their reputations, and seen sharp declines in stock valuations. Encryption is the tool-of-choice for meeting these new requirements.</p>
<p>The ever-growing use of encryption is creating new challenges to manage increased complexity. Venafi software helps organizations protect vital information assets and critical systems from compromise and failure in a cost-effective and scalable manner by automating many of the most common manual tasks associated with managing encryption.</p>","encryption, authentication-mechanisms, integrity, authenticity-and-non-repudiation-of-data",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0006/1931/61931v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0006/1931/61931v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0006/1931/61931v2-max-450x450.png, ,,

A departure from current approaches, this innovation is a hydrogel that treats damaged tissue by providing a restorative scaffold on which new cells can grow. This hydrogel, VentriGel, is made from cardiac connective tissue that is stripped of heart muscle cells through a cleansing process, freeze-dried and milled into powder form, and then liquefied into a fluid that can be easily injected into the heart. Upon reaching body temperature, the liquid turns into a semi-solid, porous gel that encourages cells to repopulate areas of damaged cardiac tissue and to preserve heart function. The hydrogel forms a scaffold to repair the tissue and possibly provides biochemical signals that prevent further deterioration in the surrounding tissues.</p>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0030/8206/308206v1-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0030/8206/308206v1-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0030/8206/308206v1-max-450x450.jpg, ,32.803827,-117.215187

As the owner of an Island Packet 485, Don experienced the frustrations of assimilating the full range of details found in 35 pounds of manuals in order to maintain his boat at the peak of performance and functionality. The design for this simple yet innovative service results from exhaustive interviews with owners, manufacturers, dealers, brokers and service personnel. The increasing complexity and sophistication of today’s boats requires greater adherence to the manufacturer’s suggested maintenance schedules. VesselVanguard makes this entire process simple and assures optimum performance both on the water and at the dock.</p>
<p>Their mission is to fill in the knowledge gap so that boaters approach each on-water experience with confidence and control. VesselVanguard enables the boat-owner to enhance their stewardship of the boat while also preserving its value. </p>
<p>The systems designed into a boat by an imaginative boat maker, and choices later made by an owner, are intended to function together to create a safe and comfortable on-board environment. VesselVanguard understands this and its purpose is to decrease the complexity of understanding and maintaining all these systems. This level of acute care delivers the most important and indefinable reality to the boat-owner: Peace of Mind and More Time on the Water.</p>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0030/6797/306797v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0030/6797/306797v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0030/6797/306797v1-max-450x450.png, ,,

<p>Today this foresight has become reality, as WiFi is available in virtually every classroom, over 50% of course material today is delivered outside the physical classroom for classes of all sizes and configurations, and there is near ubiquity for student ownership of at least one smart device.</p>
<p>In addition to rapid technology transitions in the classroom, there is competitive pressure to implement state-of-the-art instructional technology at every university to address the demands of today’s digitally savvy students. Students do not want to sit quietly in lectures in any sized classroom. Instead they want to learn by exploring and actively engaging with instructors and peer students.</p>

By providing both hardware and software components, viaCycle offers a “bike-sharing-in-a-box” solution: a combined system that frees bike-sharing operators from cumbersome kiosks and street-storage, increasing flexibility and reducing costs.</p>
<p>Bicycle sharing systems are a developing solution for preserving urban mobility, but suffer from numerous issues that prevent widespread adoption, including high costs and vandalism rates.  Moreover, existing bike share systems require extensive stationary infrastructure, including bike racks and checkout kiosks that are difficult to install and limit rider freedom. </p>
<p>In contrast, viaCycle bicycles can lock up to traditional bike racks, and are checked in and out using text messages or smart phone applications. The lack of infrastructure reduces implementation and operating costs. Additionally, operators know where all their bikes are at all times and whom their checked out to, which reduces administrative workload and cuts down on theft.</p>","transportation, transit, mobility, mobile, bicycle-sharing, bikeshare, bikesharing",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0012/3482/123482v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0012/3482/123482v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0012/3482/123482v2-max-450x450.png,5,,

<p>VigLink is built on the idea that publishers should be compensated for the content they create and the commerce they drive. The company monetizes ordinary links to over 30,000 retailers with technology that works across sites, apps, and social networks. Because the monetization is automated, content publishers can focus on creating great content and avoid the hassles of managing countless affiliate programs.</p>
<p>The largest network of its kind, VigLink maximizes earnings for tens of thousands of publishers and works with more than 30,000 merchants, processing over ten billion page views and over five hundred million clicks every month.</p>

Clicks that turn into purchases from anyone in their growing list of over 30,000 retailers, turn into commissions. Through its exclusive <a href=""http://www.viglink.com/products/convert/optimizer"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""optimizer"">optimizer</a> technology, VigLink can optionally swap existing links for more lucrative alternatives.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.viglink.com/products/insert"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""VigLink Insert"">VigLink Insert</a> uses state-of-the-art semantic technology to automatically link text mentions of merchants, brands, and products to the most relevant and valuable destination.

Publishers just build the URL with VigLink, shorten if they like, and share anywhere. Influencers get paid when clicks turn into purchases.</p>
<p>VigLink offers detailed reporting and analytics for publishers to learn which links drive the most revenue and stay focused on what’s working. </p>

Through the subsequent creation of VIOSO GmbH in 2007, the brilliant idea of projection on any surface was presented to the marketplace in the form of a software package. Since then it has undergone a rigorous development programme and today a team of 13 employees apply themselves to achieve VIOSOâ€™s goal: â€œTo supply international software for presentations!â€ </p>
<p>In 2010 the VIOSO Presenter was released as a brand new version of the old product smartprojecting. This software brings a change into the philosophy of presentations: away from simply show information to entertain you audience. Simply enhance your presentation without any previous knowledge. Use familiar programs such as PowerPoint, Word or PhotoShop as well as pictures, videos etc. and simply dragâ€™n drop them into the VIOSO Presenter. Display your presentation with special 3 D effects such as picture-in-picture with a self chosen background image. </p>
<p>Together with the media server specialist AV Stumpfl, VIOSO developed Wings VIOSO to create and control professional shows and events. Wings VIOSO is a combination of VIOSO-technology, therefore providing automatic multi display projections, stacking and warping in addition to wall correction technology and AV Stumpflâ€™s powerful media server Wings Platinum. </p>
<p>Also, several bespoke projects according to client specifications are in progress under the name VIOSO development. </p>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0008/5748/85748v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0008/5748/85748v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0008/5748/85748v1-max-450x450.png, ,,

Taking it further, summer ‘14 VIPorbit will establish the market’s first Life Manager that encompasses not only the user’s business life but their personal life as well. Collaboration, about to be introduced to the market, will be offered in an unparalleled manner. The manner will be market disruptive.</p>
<p>VIPorbit is led by co-founder and CEO Mike Muhney, the co-inventor of ACT!® and co-creator of the contact management software category, a catalyst for the multi-billion-dollar CRM (customer relationship management) industry. With the launch of VIPorbit, Muhney created the Mobile Relationship Management software category to deliver relationship-building technology designed for the way people work and live today - on mobile devices - and with no regard for whether relationships are personal or business, accommodating both.</p>
<p>The VIPorbit solutions, standalone or in sync for multi-device Apple users helps them build meaningful relationships, which lead to successful business. In VIPorbit, contacts, calendar and communications are seamlessly integrated, providing instant access to complete relationship details, quick scheduling, and effortless communication, including via social networks. A chronological log of all relationship activity is automatically created, giving users a comprehensive relationship history for each contact. Users can also record unlimited date-stamped notes for each contact. </p>
<p>The products are designed for relationship-oriented people such as entrepreneurs, business owners, salespeople, consultants, realtors, lawyers, financial advisors, and can be quickly and easily customized for any type of business yet include every aspect of personal networks as well. Garnering unanimous and exceptional media reviews through the likes of PCWorld, Appolicious, USA Today, CIO Magazine, ComputerWorld, AppAdvice, Scoblelizer, and Forbes, to name a few, VIPorbit was ranked #1 twice in the January ‘13 and ‘14 cover story issue of iBusiness Magazine’s “Top 50 Business Apps for iPhone and iPad Users”, ahead of such notables as Evernote, Filemaker, Skype, Dropbox, LinkedIn and Bento among the Top 50.</p>
<p>In January ‘13, VIPorbit released vipSync, enabling multi-device users of the iPhone and iPad to have device independence as the data entered on either would appear on both. Fall ‘13 saw the release of the Mac desktop/notebook version, thus completing the “trifecta” of solutions for the Apple family of products. As Apple has, and is, making substantial inroads in today’s business environment, the family of Apple solutions for VIPorbit users makes for a unique and compelling offering.</p>
<p>With the foundation of iPhone/iPad/Mac laid, VIPorbit Software will proceed to it’s Phase 2 of further offerings, with new products anticipated to be released on the market in mid ‘14 that will introduce a disruptive paradigm shift in how people collaborate enabling greater penetration into the neglected mass market.</p>

Itâ€™s flagship product, NxTop, combines centralized management with local execution on an enhanced Xen-based type-1 hypervisor that runs directly on end-user devices, delivering native performance and mobility. By running the workload on the PC, Virtual Computer enables companies to have centralized management without servers, storage, and networking required for server-hosted VDI. The technology supports shared image management, enabling an IT professional to manage thousands of desktops and laptops the same way that they would manage one.</p>
<p>In March 2011, Virtual Computer announced its collaboration with Lenovo to optimize Virtual Computerâ€™s NxTop client virtualization and management solution on Lenovo’s business-oriented systems. These include select models of Lenovo’s ThinkCentre A and M series desktops and ThinkPad T and X series laptops.</p>
<p>Centralized Virtual Desktop Management
One-to-many Provisioning. NxTop   provides  a central console for all desktop management activities. IT teams create and maintain a single virtual machine per operating system that can be published  to  thousands  of users. User-specific  personality, data, settings and applications are applied dynamically at each endpoint.</p>
<p>Scalable Patching with Rollback. Patches and  updates are applied on a one-to-many basis. The IT administrator applies patches once to a master virtual machine. Upon republishing, the changed data is streamed to NxTop PCs running the virtual machine. A patched image is assembled in  the background and  transparently loaded on the next reboot.  IT can also easily rollback a patch.</p>
<p>Integrated Security
AES-256 Disk Encryption. All virtual machine and system data on NxTop- enabled PCs can be encrypted, providing peace of a mind in the event that a PC containing sensitive data is lost or stolen.</p>
<p>Policy Controls. IT administrators can protect against data leakage and  unauthorized  use through a  robust set of policy controls.  Access to hardware such as  USB ports and network interfaces can be restricted  or filtered  based on centrally  defined policies at global, group, and individual-user  levels. Virtual machines can be  governed by time-based  expiration  policies and  on-demand remote disablement.</p>
<p>Remote Termination  with  Data Destruction. As an added layer of security, IT administrators can flag lost PCs for remote termination. If  a  lost  or  stolen  PC  connects  to  a  network, it  is directed  to digitally  shred all data and  encryption keys, then self- destruct.</p>
<p>Hassle-Free Data Backup and Restore
Transparent Data Protection. Based on   centrally  defined policies, NxTop periodically initiates  data backup with no  end-user interaction required.</p>
<p>Efficient Data Transmission. NxTop   backup  technology captures changes at the block level, transmitting only the blocks that have changed to NxTop Center.</p>
<p>Advanced  Management for Distributed Organizations
Intelligent Remote Office Caching. Downstream management servers may be deployed at remote offices to intelligently cache and distribute updates for more efficient bandwidth utilization.</p>
<p>Local Backup Storage.  User data backups may be  localized at remote offices, speeding system recovery and  avoiding unnecessary strain on wide area network links.</p>
<p>Remote Helpdesk. Simply  enable remote  support  from  the  NxTop  Center  console  for  immediate remote PC control â€“ even in the event of a catastrophic operating system failure such as a Windows â€œblue screen of death.â€</p>","client-side-vdi, idv, intelligent-desktop-virtualization, desktop-virtualization, vdi, virtual-desktop-infrastructure, nxtop, lenovo, intel",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0003/4842/34842v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0003/4842/34842v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0003/4842/34842v1-max-450x450.png,40,,

The release of exciting new devices such as the Oculus Rift and Razer Hydra has brought the decades-old dream of true virtual reality closer than ever, but there’s still one more piece to the puzzle: the Virtuix Omni.</p>
<p>The Omni by Virtuix™ takes virtual reality to the next level— allowing anyone to stand up and traverse virtual worlds with the natural use of their own feet. The Omni is the first virtual reality interface for moving freely and naturally in your favorite game. Moving naturally in virtual reality creates an unprecedented sense of immersion that cannot be experienced sitting down.</p>
<p>The Omni will free gamers from passive, seated gameplay, unleashing the full potential of virtual reality gaming with the Oculus Rift and future head mounted displays. Gaming on a keyboard, mouse or gamepad while seated pales in comparison to the intense experience and fun that comes from actually walking, running, and jumping in games.</p>
<p>The Omni is the result of two years of design and testing. The base of the Omni is a grooved, low-friction surface. Special pinned shoes keep the foot stabilized and prevent lateral sliding. Users walk naturally—and the result is a natural interface that works with any game or application that uses keyboard input. Walk, run, jump, crouch, or strafe—movements mapped to the keyboard can be mapped to natural motion with the Omni.</p>
<p>Applications of natural movement in virtual reality stretch far beyond gaming: training and simulation, fitness and exercising, virtual tourism, virtual tradeshows and events, meet-ups and multi-person adventures, virtual workplaces, museums, physical therapy, VR architecture, VR concerts… The possibilities are limitless. Virtual reality is the future.</p>
<p>Virtuix has launched a Kickstarter campaign to get the Omni built and into the hands of as many VR enthusiasts, gamers, researchers and developers as possible: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1944625487/omni-move-naturally-in-your-favorite-game</p>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0027/1422/271422v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0027/1422/271422v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0027/1422/271422v1-max-450x450.png, ,29.7601927,-95.3693896

It can sense general movement and special motions like steps, and most important a fall. It’s technological simple, small form factor, long battery life (1+ month) and low cost (expected to retail at 10€). A lot of care went into the design to make the device look like a fashion accessory and not like a “device”.</p>
<p>The target audience is senior people (&gt;65) that live alone, and have offspring. </p>
<p>The main use is: If a person falls or press a “panic” button, an alarm gets issued and help will come. Also, if some of the offspring wants to get hold of the user (typically by phone) and can’t for some reason, the system provides a way for them to know the user is ok, while respecting the end user privacy. The system does not provide location or activity description, just quantity of movement description, and complementary information  like number of steps taken five minutes ago.</p>
<p>The system also knows the relative position inside a home, and can distinguish from staying quiet in the bathroom for an hour or staying quiet in the living room. </p>
<p>The device communicates with any android phone, so it’s portable and continues to work outside the home if the user takes the phone with him/her. There are also some nice features for the phone, like friendly user interface, photo dial, auto-answer in case of emergency, loud speaker, microphone and cameras activation, etc.</p>
<p>VitaSensis is presently only targeting the senior people market, but the tag, without any hardware modification, can be useful in a variety of other markets, like pet tracking/fencing, object tracking/fencing, kids security, tracking objects inside buildings, like shopping carts route mapping, etc</p>
<p>The company is looking for investors in Europe Northern region, Finland, Sweden and Norway. </p>
<p>VitaSensis origins are in Oporto University, Portugal, and are already doing business in Portugal with third party, featureless, devices, but functional.</p>
<p>The vitaSensis Tag device is expected to be ready for real market testing around November 2012.</p>","healthcare, lifestyle, senior-citizens",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0041/9314/419314v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0041/9314/419314v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0041/9314/419314v2-max-450x450.png,2,,

Vor-ink™ formulations harness the exceptional conductivity of graphene: ultra-flexible and robust inks and coatings for the printed electronics market. In energy applications, Vor-x® delivers demonstrable performance gains by breaking traditional technology trade-offs between battery capacity and power output. Plastic and rubber composites with low Vor-x® loadings attain extreme levels of strength, dimensional stability, conductivity, and environmental resistance, opening new application and design possibilities.</p>
<p>Vor-x®, Vorbeck’s proprietary graphene material, was developed in the Chemical Engineering Laboratories of Princeton University by Dr. Ilhan A. Aksay, Dr. Robert K. Prud’homme, and their coworkers. The Princeton team’s pioneering work enables large-scale production of graphene. Vorbeck owns an exclusive license on the patented Princeton University graphene technology. Dr. Aksay serves an advisor to Vorbeck and on the Vorbeck Board of Directors. More information on graphene-related work at Princeton University.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 2006, Vorbeck has led the way in developing commercial applications for graphene. In 2007, Vorbeck commissioned a ton-scale production facility in Jessup, Maryland. In 2009, Vorbeck launched the world’s first commercial graphene-based product, Vor-ink™ and obtained EPA approval for the manufacture of graphene.</p>

<p>The process is simple. Users set up profiles on VoulezVousDiner.com. The host posts their dinner, including the menu, photos, date of the dinner and location. Hosts can even add a dash of personality to their menus by choosing a certain theme. Guests can easily search for dinners by city, with the option to filter by dinner theme.

<p>With the VoxPopMe app, consumers can earn money for sending video responses straight from their mobile phone in response to questions being asked by brands. </p>
<p>Brands can post questions and review incoming video responses through a self-service online platform, which offers both qualitative and quantitative analysis tools. </p>
<p>The platform also allows brands to target their question to consumers based on gender, age, location, and interest profiling. They can even invite their own customers to answer questions reserved exclusively for them. </p>
<p>The launch of VoxPopMe came about in early 2013 when founder, Dave Carruthers, a technology entrepreneur who runs a digital agency in the Midlands, realised there was an opportunity to leverage smartphone technology to change the way brands solicit consumer opinion, making it cost-effective, fast, reliable and incredibly targeted when compared to traditional market research tools. </p>
<p>By leveraging mobile technology VoxPopMe has massively reduced the time it takes for businesses to conduct market research. Now they can quickly and efficiently canvas the opinion of thousands of consumers in their target market, and have video responses within just a few hours of posting a question - minutes in most cases.  </p>
<p>The insight opens up a two-way conversation between brands and their customers, rewarding the customer for their opinion, and helping to shape the future of the brand’s products and services in line with customer needs. </p>
<p>VoxPopMe’s app users - also known as the consumer panel - have the option to sign up quickly and easily with a Facebook account, or sign up with email and provide some basic profile information to allow questions to be targeted to them.  Responses to questions only need to be between 15 and 60 seconds long to be submitted, after which the video is sent off for approval before the user is rewarded by means of a credit which is instantly deposited into their VoxPopMe account. As soon as users reach £10 they may collect their earnings through the app’s cash out facility integrated with trusted brand PayPal.

The solution can be deployed stand-alone using Walkbase sensors or leveraging WiFi infrastructure already installed in a building. Consumer’s unique Wi-Fi identifiers (MAC addresses) are hashed to ensure data privacy protection.</p>
<p>Our retail analytics dashboard shows traffic trends by store and, given a larger installation, within departments inside a store. Capture rate (percent of passers by entering) can be measured, along with dwell time by store or zone and proportion of loyal repeat customers. This allows comparisons across time and different stores in a chain – all valuable information for a store or retail chain manager to identify opportunities to improve customer service and conversions to sales.</p>
<p>Marketing teams can measure footfall changes in response to general or store-specific advertising campaigns, providing an understanding of whether campaigns are generating traffic. The Walkbase integration with Google Universal Analytics allows our customers to combine data from campaigns with footfall data and view it side-by-side (available in beta). Further, retailers launching mobile applications for their customers can use the Walkbase real-time API to personalise the app experience based on location and (with opt-in) customer profile.</p>

<p>We’ve designed a platform which helps businesses eliminate online confusion, while at the same time raise efficiency and reduce costs.</p>
<p>Think of it like a GPS, but instead of giving driving directions, WalkMe™ guides users every step of the way to successfully complete their online tasks. Through a series of interactive tip balloons overlaid on the screen, tasks are broken down into short, step-by-step guided instructions. These balloons help users act, react and progress through their online experience. WalkMe™ eliminates guesswork, as well the frustration of following video tutorials or digging through tedious Q&amp;A pages.</p>
<p>WalkMe™ focuses on solving the needs that are specific to customers and strives to deliver technology that helps them be more effective and efficient. For example, we work with customer service managers to help increase self-service adoption and reduce incoming service requests, thus freeing them to focus their efforts on more critical and difficult customer care concerns. We also give SaaS providers an indispensable tool to easily highlight new and advanced features on their software, without their customers complaining of the inability to understand how to operate them. We provide real value to you and to your customers, users and employees.</p>
<p>Customers use WalkMe™ to increase conversion rates, reduce customer service costs, increase self-service adoption, accelerate training and improve customer experience.</p>
<p>WalkMe™ also empowers businesses to collect useful analytics allowing you to track just how your users interacted with the platform. This invaluable data allows customer service managers, UX managers, training professionals and sales managers to better fine-tune their online guided instructions to match their users’ needs.</p>
<p>WalkMe™ has also received wide industry recognition and acclaim. Amongst them: “Cool Vendor” by Gartner, Red Herring Top 100 Award, “Top Apps That Will Change Your Business” by CIO Magazine, and more.</p>
<p>Implementing WalkMe™ does not require integration or modification to your website, or any prior technical knowledge.</p>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0018/3918/183918v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0018/3918/183918v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0018/3918/183918v2-max-450x450.png, ,,

<p>reShoot makes it easy for almost anyone to easily create perfect videos with our “edit on the fly” technology. Features unique and proprietary to reShoot include:</p>

Insert reShoot: Record and/or append new video into existing footage; Insert reShoot allows you to choose exactly where the new footage can be inserted.
videoArc™ feature enables users to add new footage to existing video recordings left on pause in the app or saved to the camera roll. Instead of capturing dozens of clips, videoArc provides a single video stream or montage that can be edited and extended.
Insert Clip: Import a clip from the camera roll and insert it into any reShoot video.
Clippers: Cut out unwanted footage from any reShoot video.
Preview: Preview the whole video or just the last few seconds before the edit mark.
Pause Recording: Pause as often or as long as needed before resuming a video recording (even when the app is closed, the video remains available until it is saved or deleted).

<p>We are a company of engineers and technologists who build easy-to-use advanced technology tools for our peers. Beyond product, though, is a deep pool of expertise and service. While other companies are often merely sales teams for outsourced software, our engineers work directly with our customers, and we use those experiences to enhance and constantly improve our software and services.</p>
<p>We are guided by the following principles:</p>
<p>All information is on our website
Many software companies hide their demos and white papers behind lead collection forms that are are fed to rooms full of salesman who call and email you constantly. Everything we have: white papers, the free demos, extensive research reports, price lists, are all available to you directly, and you’ll never have to type in your email address to get it.</p>
<p>Open sales model
We literally have no sales staff– if you call for product information you’ll talk to an experienced engineer whose only interest is helping you solve your performance problems. No meaningless acronyms, no time-wasting sales strategies, and no commissions. Our technical staff talks directly with our customers, which strengthens our customer relationships while providing valuable feedback we use to make our products and services better.</p>
<p>Software should be a pleasure to use
We believe that software should be intuitive, transparent and offer a depth of features that reveal themselves naturally as you learn more about the subject and application.</p>","performance-testing, load-testing, scalability, testing-software",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0015/0740/150740v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0015/0740/150740v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0015/0740/150740v2-max-450x450.png, ,,

Since selling his previous company and moving to Bristol from London in 2005 Mike has looked at many different investment opportunities.

He then found that existing UK based incubators were mainly in London and required investment through a funding vehicle, not directly into the startups themselves, making it difficult for investors to benefit from the all important SEIS tax relief.With the establishment of the Engine Shed, Mike saw that Bristol now had the perfect venue for an internet incubator and after assembling a team of top Bristol based mentors and business advisors, WebStart Bristol was born.</p>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0045/6093/456093v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0045/6093/456093v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0045/6093/456093v1-max-450x450.png,6,,

The three ways Werkadoo differentiates itself from the job boards and virtual working spaces are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Match-Making: Werkadoo’s unique, new match-making engine will pair up your project needs as a business or project manager with exactly the right candidate or team based on a combination of soft personality traits and qualified expertise. For businesses this means no more headaches and sifting through thousands of resumes. Post a job with Werkadoo, and your top matches will be brought to you instantly, saving time and money. For professionals, this means you can focus on doing what you do best, and not business development because the matching engine will be bringing you the projects that best fit your working style. </p></li>
<li><p>Team Formation: Werkadoo gives you the ability to form teams before starting work on projects; so all of the individual superstars out there can band together to form dream teams and compete on a higher level with the big agencies. </p></li>
<li><p>Werkspace Customization: Werkadoo knows that every project is different, and requires different tools. They also know that every person is different, and has their own tools and preferences. For that reason, Werkadoo will be allowing you to plug in all of those great collaboration and communication tools you already use, right into your fully customizable Werkspace.</p></li>

<p>Our Mission:
Wideo endeavours to provide a simple and intuitive tool that enables people without previous knowledge or training to create quality online videos.</p>
<p>How Wideo can be used: </p>
<ol>
<li>Wideo for Business:
In the past, making an explanation video for a product has been an expensive and extremely complicated process. 
Wideo offer’s the chance to create demo videos for free, without the need to have any prior training or knowledge. </li>
</ol>
<p>Using an explainer video will not only project the business’s message, but also keep up with the continually gaining momentum of online video.</p>
<p>With more people choosing to watch rather than read written content, it’s possible to hook the target audience with an explainer video from the get go! </p>
<ol>
<li>Wideo for Education:
A great way for educators and students to convey their messages easily in a creative and fun way is to use videos in their classroom. Wideo can be used for in-class presentations (teachers or students alike), creating tutorials, teaching a foreign language or even TESL training. The animated videos can be used to help teach students with special needs, convey behavioural and social skills training, teach art, writing and design.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just one method of transmitting knowledge has never been enough. Video doesn’t only just add emphasis; It’s becoming crucial to learning! Online video is clearly an essential teaching tool that can powerfully impact student information retention and engagement. </p>
<ol>
<li>Wideo for Fun:
Make animated e-cards with a fun twist and bring them to life with a personal touch. Create music videos to favourite songs or make an animated series. Send out special occasion cards that come to life with personal thought and creativity. </li>

But that is another way: Wine in Black is an exclusive online store who chooses a constantly changing selection of fine wines for his customers on a weekly basis. Here, the experienced Wine focused in Black team exclusively on premium wines that are always among the best in its category. Due to the small quantities that are available from these wines, there is a very fast change in the range and you can search for and discover after the fantastic diversity of the wine.

We’ll bring you together and make sure you meet the right job or the right candidate. It’s about time someone set out to do something different.”</p>
<p>Wiseri is a job search platform which has a simple and sincere goal: to help as many people as possible find a job and to help businesses find the best candidates. The wiseri selection process ensures that candidates are only presented to companies where they have a good chance of being offered a job, and conversely, that companies are only presented with candidates with the skills and experience they are looking for.</p>
<p>In November 2011, wiseri.com secured a round of investment worth 120,000 euros which was provided by 17 investors, all of whom are involved in the digital industries. Crucially for wiseri, this meant they brought to the company not only their money, but also their expertise and experience in the industry. In similar style to the way businesses in Silicon Valley secure seed capital, this investment round did not involve any outside investors or investment funds; but rather, the funds were provided by people who know and believe in what wiseri does. Furthermore, the round of investment was carried out from start to finish in a record time of 37 days and all communication between wiseri and its investors was conducted through email with complete transparency.</p>
<p>On 14th January 2012, wiseri revealed a new side of its online platform, a system that sources talent from the crowd to form an expert selection team. In doing so, wiseri became the first company in the job search industry to incorporate gamification and crowdsourcing into its system. Members of the selection team are called Wisors and any job application made through wiseri.com first has to pass through the hands of a Wisor, who selects only those applications best matched to the job position and presents them to the company, taking care to give genuine and useful feedback to each candidate who didn’t quite make it to ensure they have a better chance the next time round. And to make sure that the applications are checked by someone who knows what they’re doing, only people who have already passed through the wiseri application system can go on to become Wisors; and once you are a Wisor, well, then you can enjoy a whole range of perks along the way, saving up wirees (wiseri’s currency) as you go that you can cash in for a whole load of prizes.?</p>","jobs, job-search, artificial-intelligence, candidates, candidate-matching, matching, crowdsourcing, tech-jobs, online-jobs, gamification",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0013/3178/133178v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0013/3178/133178v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0013/3178/133178v2-max-450x450.png,12,,

<p>A team of physicists, led by Professor Marin Solja developed the theoretical basis for this novel method for wireless electric power transfer in 2005, and validated their theories experimentally in 2007.  The magnetic fields of two properly designed devices with closely matched resonant frequencies can couple into a single continuous magnetic field. </p>
<p>Prof. Solja team showed how to use this phenomenon to enable the transfer of power from one device to the other at high efficiency and over a distance range that is useful for real-world applications.  This âœstrong couplingâ€ enables the devices to exchange energy via magnetism, and avoids the potential safety hazards and inefficiency often associated with radiated electro-magnetic energy. Their demonstration of wireless power transfer showed a 60 watt light bulb being illuminated from a power source over 2 meters away, and their results were published in the prestigious journal Science in July 2007.  </p>
<p>Prof. Solja was recognized with a MacArthur Fellowship in September 2008, awarded by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation.  In addition, his work was recognized as one of the Top Ten Emerging Technologies for 2008 by Technology Review, Top 100 Science Stories of 2007 by Discover Magazine, and cited in The New York Times Magazine: The Year in Ideas  2007.</p>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0004/6816/46816v1-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0004/6816/46816v1-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0004/6816/46816v1-max-450x450.jpg, ,42.36867,-71.150248

It combines microblogging features found in Twitter and Yammer,  project management features found in BaseCamp, and general collaboration and organizational features found in SharePoint and Lotus Notes.   Like Yammer, WizeHive lets groups of folks establish a private and continuous feed of activity.  By setting up a private workspace, WizeHive users can communicate on one or more topics through a browser interface, a desktop client, or most importantly, by sending and receiving emails.   But WizeHive extends the Yammer model by allowing those with multiple interests or groups to set up separate workspaces for each group yet optionally see all of the activity in one integrated feed.</p>
<p>Messages entered or sent through WizeHive can contain text, links, graphics and attached files.   Uploaded files can be shared among workspace members and most Word or Excel compatible files can  be edited collaboratively right from within WizeHive.</p>
<p>WizeHive extends the collaboration model further by providing task integrated management where you can organize and manage yourself and optionally your co-workers.   You can assign and manage tasks for each workspace independently or organize and manage your own activities across all workspaces. </p>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0003/2717/32717v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0003/2717/32717v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0003/2717/32717v1-max-450x450.png, ,40.0716358,-75.3018405

In contrast to credit cards, traditional loans and bank overdrafts, the idea is that money is repaid quickly, thereby avoiding long-term debt. </p>
<p>The alternative for many consumers might be an unauthorised overdraft, which can incur significant bank charges, bounced cheques or a cash loan from friends or family.</p>

This is where the www Audience Engagement Platform (AEP) comes in.

They help us gain insights that inform the content we create, and the audiences we are trying to reach. The AEP enables the management, workflow, distribution, measurement and optimization of content in virtually any form, across multiple content platforms, globally. With this proprietary suite of tools, we can engage with advocates, influencers, customers and the multiple signals that influence them and the content they care about.

WooMe’s in-browser video and voice capability delivers a live interactive experience where users play for fun, to hook up, or just meet new people around shared interests.

With WooMe, meeting people online is transformed into a live interactive experience that makes sifting through contrived profiles a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Founded in 2006, WooMe’s management team has experience in bringing innovative web applications to market for companies including: AltaVista, CMGI, BT, Accenture, Qwest, Shopzilla, Trilogy. Stephen Stokols, Co-Founder/CEO, successfully sold an internet start-up and went on to become BT’s youngest VP, growing their eCommerce revenues over 300% to over $1bn in his first 12 months.

<p>WorkingPoint founders worked for Intuit and were behind the creation of QuickBooks and Quicken. They believe Quickbooks had become too complicated and that the small business software segment was ripe for SaaS-based innovation. Tom Proulx, WorkingPoint Chairman, and Tate Holt, CEO, were passionately committed to creating a complete small business product that is well-integrated, simple to use, and of very high quality. WorkingPoint launched a comprehensive software package that fulfilled that commitment in July of 2009 and has been adding additional high-value features since.

The app provides parents and children with the opportunity to interact with one another, where the child is encouraged to use his creativity and craft a DIGITAL BOOK which can proudly be shared with family and friends. </p>
<p>The app is developed by Danish primary school teacher Janus Madsen who has more than 15 years of experience in teaching young children to read and write. The app is based on the ideas of ‘learning to read by writing’ and ‘writing and discovering’ where the child uses its current level of written language abilities to create a text to a picture taken with the iPad or iPhone. The child tells an adult what he/she has written after which the adult can write the text in conventional writing. When the child compares its writing with the writing of the adult, spelling of often used words as well as significant nuances and elements of the written language is registered by the child and these experiences can be used on longer terms in the learning process. The app can also be used by younger children who can use the recording function to tell their stories, which subsequently can be put into writing by an adult.</p>","edtech, edchat, education, ccss, ipad-app, iphone-app",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0034/1529/341529v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0034/1529/341529v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0034/1529/341529v1-max-450x450.png, , ,

Would Rocky have been able to beat Clubber Lang (a.k.a. Mr.T) without “eye of the tiger” playing in his training montage. We here at H2O Audio think not. They also believe that the inspirational and spiritual power of music should not be reserved only for the Rocky Balboas and other land loving athletes of the world. As surfers, wakeboarders, paddlers, and swimmers we encourage H2O Audio users to experience their music in any element.</p>
<p>Like many other inventive business endeavors the seed of H2O Audio was planted in graduate school, i.e. FedEx. The first brain child of the founding fathers was a waterproof CD case fashioned with a pair of crudely engineered waterproof headphones. At the time people couldn’t fathom, pun intended, the need for an underwater music player. Fortunately for swimmers, surfers, wakeboarders, paddlers, and water enthusiasts everywhere they were not deterred. In 2002 a plan was set forth to design an mp3 housing that would allow users to take their music anywhere and everywhere. The result was a waterproof housing for the iRiver mp3 player that can operate at depths of up to 200ft (DV Series.) In 2005 the H2O Audio family evolved to accommodate the leader in personal mp3 players, Apples iPod. As Apple continues to alter the handheld music player universe and the demand for waterproof protection increases H2O Audio will continue to offer the best waterproof iPod cases and waterproof accessories in the industry.</p>
<p>Lap swimmers will suffer in silence no more, triathletes will conquer land and sea without missing a beat, and rock and roll will no longer be just an obstacle and a survival maneuver for kayakers. Waterproof your playlist and experience music in any element.</p>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0034/0757/340757v1-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0034/0757/340757v1-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0034/0757/340757v1-max-450x450.jpg, , ,

Xcovery’s mission is to develop low toxicity molecular targeted oral drugs which will allow continuous therapy and will not require dosing “holidays”. Low toxicity will allow a greater “therapeutic window” and the ability to more effectively treat multiple cancers with higher potency. Low toxicity will also allow our drugs to better be used in combination therapy where other, current therapies, are too toxic to be effective.</p>
<p>Our Team Xcovery’s CEO, Sheridan Snyder, is a veteran entrepreneur who began his biotech career in 1981 when he founded Genzyme, followed by Biotage, Upstate Biotechnology and now Xcovery and Tyrogenex. Mr. Snyder has funded Xcovery’s first 5 years of development, through his personal investment vehicle, BioCatalyst International, Inc. This is consistent with his “formula” for developing more than 14 start-ups over a 40 year period, all of which are operating successfully today.</p>
<p>Xcovery’s Chief Scientific Officer, Dr. Chris Liang, served as Director, Medicinal Chemistry at SUGEN (acquired by Pfizer in 2003) where he developed Sutent®, an FDA approved VEGFR/PDGFR angiogenesis inhibitor for the treatment of kidney cancer and second-line gastrointestinal cancer in Gleevec-resistant patients. The result of his knowledge, extensive experience and a unique set of medicinal chemistry design tools have enabled Xcovery to create a broad portfolio of kinase inhibitors.</p>
<p>Xcovery’s Vice President, Oncology, Dr. Jay Gibbons, brings more than 25 years of oncology research and management experience to the team with a strong emphasis on translational medicine. During his previous role as AVP, Oncology Research at Wyeth, he was instrumental in filing eight IND’s and the NDA for Torisel® (temsirolimus), currently approved for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma.</p>", ,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0031/6165/316165v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0031/6165/316165v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0031/6165/316165v1-max-450x450.png, ,,

<p>Relationship value should not be determined by the number or frequency of updates, or via endless social media chattering about non-essential things. Nor should it be created from just passing along what others say en masse to everyone else.</p>
<p>The best kind of relationships is built on engagement, created when you provide value to everyone with whom you interact, every time.</p>
<p>Whether it is through sharing valuable tips on building a company, providing an introduction to a talented developer or a journalist, or an invitation to a private networking event, when you extend help and support, your relationship value grows.</p>
<p>The good you do is rewarded when your network of contacts reciprocate with information, introduction, invitations, and/or endorsements of their own.</p>

Long duration dialogues are conversations and audio content ranging from 5 seconds to several hours. Yap specializes in accurately transcribing these dialogues for a variety of different scenarios including voicemail-to-text, conference call transcriptions, analysis of customer phone calls and voice-activated mobile messaging.</p>
<p>The company was a TechCrunch finalist in 2007. Their management team previously worked on Apple’s iPod, Honda’s navigational systems, IBM’s ViaVoice, Microsoft’s Tellme speech division and Nuance’s Dragon products.</p>
<p>Yap white labels its SaaS platform – i.e., Yap Speech Cloud(TM) – to enable diverse use cases, including messaging, call analytics and voicemail-to-text. For example, Microsoft uses Yap for voice-based mobile messaging applications. Their end users can say anything they want to and have Yap’s platform transcribe it into text (far more convenient than typing on the fumbling with a devices keypad while driving). MetroPCS also is a Yap customer. Cincinnati Bell, a regional carrier, uses Yap-based technology to convert subscriber voicemails into text. The carrier was a competitive win away from SpinVox (now Nuance). Part of the allure for Yap’s service is that it’s completely automated. That means there is no need for humans listening to messages, typing them out, and then sending them back out, giving Yap a real advantage in ensuring privacy. Because Yap is completely machine powered, the company is able to offer lower costs, higher speeds and greater consistency.</p>","voice-to-text, voice, speech, mobile, speech-to-text, dictation, transcription, messaging, voicemail",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0000/0046/46v16-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0000/0046/46v16-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0000/0046/46v16-max-450x450.png, ,35.22806,-80.856178

An event on YeHive can be anything from an extremely large event to a birthday party with a few friends. YeHive gives that birthday party an online site for shared photos, videos, and comments. Better yet, a friend or relative who could not attend can follow along live by searching for and checking into the event on the website or app</p>
<p>YeHive has distinct characteristics that set it apart from other social media sites and will appeal to users wanting to connect solely through the things that interest them as opposed to scrolling through a multitude of users’ posts on unrelated topics.</p>
<p>Yehive’s homepage is comprised of events displayed in descending order by the number of users checked in. Personalization of events comes into play through the “My Events” tab. This tab will display events that you have created, events that you have checked in to, and events created by users that you have favorited. A user is able to follow another user by selecting “Favorite” on the other user’s profile. You will see all events they create, display in your “My Events” tab. The “Events Near Me” tab will show you a map view of events that are near your set location. Your location can be determined by GPS or you can set your location by going to the “Events Near Me” tab and setting your location. Anyone can create an event using the “Create an Event” tab. Create any event that you would like others to be able to interact with. YeHive has recently added an option for private events under the Create an Event tab. Private events allow users to create password protected events and share that event and password with other users. The possibilities are endless. You can search for any event by name. You can search for any user by name in the search engine located under your Profile tab. Your profile will keep a history of events that you have checked in to and all of the photos and videos that you have uploaded.

Yesware’s Reports and Analytics give salespeople unprecedented feedback about how their messages are being received. </p>
<p>This is not new technology.

<p>The company’s initial target market for B2B salespeople. For these people, a productivity tool that can help them reach their sales goals is extremely valuable. Yesware offers 100 free tracking emails per month to start and you can earn up to 100 additional emails for referring friends, or upgrade to a Plus account with unlimited email tracking. The company also offers Team, Enterprise, and Custom product plans. Learn more at www.yesware.com/plans-and-pricing. </p>

Their software, however, is almost exclusively aimed at sales management and oversight instead of helping salespeople sell more.

Their aim is to optimize the advertisement units of your website. They attempt to capitalize on a primary shortcoming of contextual advertisements: After their initial placement into text by publishers, formatting, placement, and layout is seldom altered and tested to see if response can be improved.</p>
<p>YieldBuild is able to automatically optimize your siteâ€™s ad spots with the most profitable combination of ad layout, style, and network. The system continually tests alternative configurations of layouts, networks, and color as it looks for the highest performing ones. It takes about 10,000 impressions to train the system. As users become unresponsive to the ads, the system switches to a more profitable combination of layout and networks. Setup is easy and similar to Google AdSense.</p>
<p>In addition to supporting some of the most popular ad network options, YieldBuild offers its publishers two ad source options - the Premium Display and Premium Text Ad Programs - with which to maximize page revenue. Drawing from choice network and agency network sources, like Microsoft pubCenter, Advertising.com and Traffic Marketplace, the Premium Ad Programs grant medium-sized publishers access to ads typically restricted to much larger publishers only.</p>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0004/1091/41091v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0004/1091/41091v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0004/1091/41091v1-max-450x450.png, ,37.7877967,-122.3989376

<p>After only 5 days of treatment with TVT patients are able to stop using the contact lenses, eye drops and their reading glasses for up to 12 months at a time before succeeding with TVT is needed. What is even greater than correcting for presbyopia non-invasively, is correcting both eyes without compromising any distance vision. On the contrary, Yolia’s treatment improves both near and distance vision, a unique feature no single other alternative can provide.</p>","presbyopia, reading, glasses, cornea, lasik, vision, non-invasive, contact-lenses", , , ,8,,

<p>Fantasy players have to make decisions before plays actually start. They awarded varying amounts of points depending on the play they choose, with more rare or difficult plays earning more points.  </p>
<p>Founder Kris Billmaier used to play an informal version of YouBeQB with friends during football games, but decided to develop it into an actual online game.

Instead of long difficult to share URLs, what if you could navigate the web by simply inputting a word or phrase without the for https, .coms, or /’s. What if you could verbally share URLs &amp; more?</p>
<p>Yumber is empowering people to create their own VRLs (verbal resource locators) which serve as simple verbal pathways to information that is difficult to remember and share. Instead of having to share difficult information through email, social media, or print, with this new technology you can share complex information verbally with ease. These VRLs, or as they are called, Yumbers, allow you to share hard to remember information such as physical addresses, phone numbers, URLs, etc. by simply attaching the target ( to a word or phrase which can easily be spoken and remembered by someone else. </p>
<p>Whether you are trying to share your new address with a long lost friend you met at the market, or a funny YouTube video with an audience of thousands, you can do so simply and verbally by telling them the Yumber. So what is a Yumber? A Yumber is a word or phrase that redirects the user to a specific target. A target can be a URL, phone number, physical address, email address, file, collection of files, photos, etc. virtually anything you want to share can be tied to a Yumber and then shared verbally face to face, over the radio, on the tv, or from a stage to thousands of people. </p>
<p>Try it yourself, goto Yumber.com and enter the Yumber: </p>
<p>One man band </p>
<p>You will find yourself watching a YouTube video located at a complicated YouTube URL without requiring you to speak the computer language necessary to read that lengthy YouTube address: </p>
<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXMuWi0dUBc </p>
<p>So what is a Yumber? It is natural, it is the marriage of word of mouth and technology, it is the way you learned to speak from birth, which technology, until now, has attempted to train out of you. With Yumber.com you can share anything with anyone anywhere using a simple word or phrase that you created for that purpose. </p>
<p>Why tell someone I will email you the link later, Or I will email you the file later, when you can simply tell them the associated Yumber to the target now and allow them to look it up at their convenience? The Internet was created by techies for techies. However, even these techies realized the need to evolve the Internet when the number of sites grew to the point at which it become difficult to remember all of the IP addresses of the new sites. </p>
<p>In its infancy the Internet was navigates by using IP addresses such as 192.168.0.1. To simplify navigation the a second layer was created, which is the domain name based system we still use today. This domain name system, complete with https, .coms, and /’s alike, is still on the level with the old and unintuitive MS DOS command prompt. </p>
<p>Just as Apple evolved the computer with its intuitive and human friendly operating system, Yumber is seeking to evolve the sharing of technology by adding another layer of simplicity that is more intuitive than the last. Instead of humans having to conform with the confines of computer language as defined by technology, Yumber adds a layer of humanity to technology allowing people to share themselves and their interests verbally in face to face settings. </p>
<p>Whether one on one, or while presenting to large audiences, Yumber helps you to put the power back in word of mouth communication.</p>","sharing, social-networking, business, linking, redirection", , , ,5,32.7153292,-117.1572551

Each product is personally vetted by Zady’s founders, using criteria for sustainability, including whether the product is locally-sourced, handmade, uses high-quality raw materials, is environmentally-conscious, or made in the U.S.A. The brands are required to sign a contract verifying the location of the company, the manufacturing city, and the source of the raw materials. However, consumers won’t need to compromise style for a clear conscience. All products sold on Zady are high-quality, timeless in style, and are build to last, withstanding fleeting seasonal trends and the short life-spans of poorly-made “fast fashion” items. </p>
<p>As such, Zady will be the arbiter of authenticity-meets-taste for this generation of conscious consumers. </p>","e-commerce, commerce, new-york, supply-chain, origins, ethical, story",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0023/9306/239306v3-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0023/9306/239306v3-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0023/9306/239306v3-max-450x450.png, ,40.7448046,-73.9935406

Adipose tissue (fat) is composed primarily of cells that store unused calories for later use. The balance between how the body stores excess calories and later accesses these depots when required plays a critical role in determining the overall size of the fat tissue, and therefore, an individual’s weight. Zafgen’s groundbreaking approach targets obesity at its biological foundation by safely restoring the balance of fat metabolism, driving the loss of fat and a return to a more healthy body weight. Zafgen’s leadership and scientific advisors include the leading experts in obesity, metabolic disorders and medicinal chemistry.

<p>ZapMe was originally designed to allow people to respond to a call-to-action via traditional advertising mediums (see example below), by sending a key-code via SMS to 13ZAPME. They then instantly receive a customised SMS message with link to Mobile site or multimedia content. They can then click through to a mobile site or other content e.g. multimedia. From there they can enter data or download content. Using Google Maps API we can send them to the nearest retailer with a redeemable coupon etc.</p>
<p>All data including ad response, CTR and demographics are stored in the platform and can be gathered for full reporting to the advertiser. ZapMe is a Mobile and Web based solution and has a user management system and full backend administration interface which offers full self service.</p>
<p>The ZapMe platform can now also be utilized as a mobile site, application and content delivery platform for all developers, brands, agency, and corporate clients.</p>
<p>How it works: Clients would register and access the administration interface and ingest their content and setup the SMS message etc. They then register there key-code and its ready. Traditional advertising mediums are then used to offer call-to-action (see examples above). ZapMe can also develop the content/mobile sites or applications for clients if needed. E.g. Virgin Blue releases a new branded mobile application and ZapMe is used as the distribution platform.</p>
<p>Business model is very simple with a campaign registration fee and cost per delivery to client. There is also the option for content development (Mobile site, sound, video, application etc.).</p>
<p>All requests are made to unique 13ZAPME number despite the campaign that is running, this means that people donâ€™t have to remember a different number each time they see a mobile enabled advertisement. There would also be a ZapMe mobile site and application that people could access from any phone and they could enter a key-code or search all campaigns and offers.</p>","mobile, content, mobile-advertising, platform, mobile-marketing, proximity, location",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0006/7222/67222v2-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0006/7222/67222v2-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0006/7222/67222v2-max-450x450.jpg,3,,

The most powerful encryption and key management architectures available today, with the flexibility to upgrade into the future.</p>
<p>A passion to simplify. Zebra can extend the reach of your existing tools beyond business boundaries, without IT involvement.</p>
<p>Zebra started with a very basic idea: Security should help you share information, not get in the way. Yet everywhere we look, we see examples of security being a barrier, not an enabler. Zebra enables you to protect your information simply, conveniently and effectively, and share it with anyone securely.</p>
<p>Sharing information is a simple concept, yet there is no simple solution for sharing outside the security perimeter. The perimeter only protects what is inside, and does not protect information shared outside. Zebra’s simple tools protect your information at all times, no matter where it travels. A ZPS file (Zebra Portable Safe) works through the entire lifecycle of a document – creation, sharing, modification, storage, retrieval, and destruction or expiration.

<p>How Zeenoh Started</p>
<p>On a quiet evening in 2008, JD, Zeenoh’s founder, dreamt that he was flying. In the course of his adventure, he was pursued by a big question mark (?) symbol. He was caught up in the chase, and as the symbol stuck to him there was a big explosion. He then saw pieces of letters floating in the horizon. It took a while before he figured out that the set of letters spell his name, and the word “Zeenoh” was highlighted. People sometimes pronounce “Zeenoh” as “Sino”, which means “Who?” in English.</p>
<p>As you become more curious about the games we develop, the more you become interested to Zeenoh Games.</p>

<p>ZeeVee was conceived in 2006 by technology experts Vic Odryna, Jeremy Greene, Steve Metzger and Andy Marcuvitz, who realized that widespread adoption of HD video was being limited by relative cost and complexity. Upgrading from analog to digital video distribution was costly and complicated; the ZeeVee team saw this as the primary disconnect between explosive emergence of HDTVs and customers’ ability to access high quality video content. In a breathtaking development phase, they hired leading engineers in TV and broadcast technologies and harnessed the latest technology for digital signal processing. ZeeVee reverse engineered the typical video distribution system, launching ZvBox in May 2008 to widespread acclaim. Since then, the company has continued to revolutionize digital video distribution by producing products that are commercial grade, highly flexible, extremely reliable and incredibly cost-effective.</p>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0003/2855/32855v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0003/2855/32855v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0003/2855/32855v1-max-450x450.png, , ,

<p>Over the past five years, there has been an explosion in apps and services that facilitate project management, workflows, tasks, and to-do lists, such as Basecamp, Wunderlist, Asana, and Evernote. According to Infotrends, there are 100 million busy mobile professionals and consumers in the US who are expected to consolidate, prioritize, and never miss deadlines, across all these projects and apps.  These users need an integrated system that prioritizes their tasks, regardless of the source, and fits those tasks into their calendar.</p>
<p>Unlike all recent “smart” apps that manage either appointments or tasks, ZenDay transforms Time Management by dynamically combining calendars and tasks from multiple sources into one unified timeline.
ZenDay synchronizes with multiple task and project services to serve as a global planning tool for prioritizing, planning, and updating tasks, projects, and workflows. ZenDay can replace several apps on users mobile devices.</p>
<p>Our recent results have validated key product and business hypothesis:</p>
<p>·   After more than 250K free downloads, users love ZenDay’s Floating Tasks concept and “will miss this feature in every other calendar app”
·   Users are buying ZenDay’s synchronization plug-ins, such as Google Tasks, Evernote, and are requesting more plug-ins, like Toodledo
·   ZenDay’s 3D timeline is relevant and attracts OEMs’ attention:
  o  Samsung signed an app sourcing contract with ZenDay
  o  Google Play featured ZenDay in 50 countries
  o  Google India called ZenDay “Best App of 2013 For Everyday Life”
  o  Xiaomi featured ZenDay in their Store</p>

<p>So, we built ZeroVM.</p>
<p>ZeroVM is an open-source lightweight virtualization platform, based on the Google Native Client project. It offers three major benefits:</p>
<p>Speed: The fastest virtual servers in the market today take at least 2 minutes to create. ZeroVM takes less than 5 milliseconds, or about 1/20000th of that time. This huge speedup makes it possible to separate every single task into its own container.
Isolation: ZeroVM is the first hypervisor to isolate each individual user of an application. Old fashioned hypervisors require sharing of one virtual server between multiple users, making app development much harder.
Efficiency: ZeroVM only virtualizes the server parts that do the actual work. Existing clouds are giant server farms that are spending precious resources virtualizing unneeded things.</p>","cloud-computing, virtualization, openstack, bigdata, paas, iaas, saas, cloud, hadoop, techstars, techstars-cloud-2013",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0025/8420/258420v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0025/8420/258420v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0025/8420/258420v1-max-450x450.png,5,29.4241219,-98.4936282

<p>In the event of a disaster, recovering your company’s terrabytes of data and the business processes you rely on is something you may rarely think about, but something your IT department deals with every day.</p>
<p>Today, enterprises of all sizes are deploying applications on virtualized IT infrastructures and clouds. The values of virtualization including flexibility, scalability and mobility complicate business continuity efforts in times of disaster. To realize the benefits of virtualization, organizations need to optimize IT processes for virtual environments. Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery is difficult - because to date there have been no virtual-ready replication methods that scale for large data centers. Traditional physical replication tools are complex &amp; manual, while virtual replication tools are not built for scale and reliability. With hypervisor-based replication, all that changes. Zerto is storage agnostic, simple to install, intuitive to use, &amp; is suited for both data centers and cloud.</p>
<p>Founded by a team of storage industry veterans, Zerto provides large enterprises with business continuity and disaster recovery solutions designed specifically for virtualized infrastructure and the cloud. Zerto Virtual Replication is the industry’s first hypervisor-based replication solution for tier-one applications, replacing traditional array-based BC/DR solutions that were not built to deal with the virtual paradigm.</p>

<p>Zidisha is based on the conviction that small-scale entrepreneurs in developing countries are capable of interacting responsibly with peer-to-peer lenders via a self-regulating web platform, without needing local intermediaries to communicate and manage loan transactions on their behalf.  Though there are other microlending websites that allow individuals to contribute funds toward microloans of their choice, all of them rely on local microfinance organizations to communicate with lenders, create loan applications and collect repayments. In these intermediated microlending platforms, the communication is all one way, so that the borrower is often unaware of the lenders who funded his or her loan. The average intermediary organization adds over 30% - sometimes as much as 100% - in fees and interest to loans raised through these websites to cover its own administrative expenses. Such high interest rates reduce borrowers’ profits, sometimes to the point of making them poorer than they were before they received the loan.</p>
<p>Unlike the postings on other microlending platforms, the loan applications and comments posted on Zidisha’s loan pages are written by the borrowers themselves. This opens the way for dialogue between lenders and borrowers, so that lenders can receive answers to their inquiries about the loan and business directly from the entrepreneur they are funding. Eliminating unnecessary intermediaries also decreases cost of the loans. The average Zidisha borrower pays only about 8% (flat rate) in annual interest and fees, including interest paid out to lenders. This is far below the rates traditionally charged for microfinance loans in developing countries.  Reducing interest costs allows the entrepreneurs to keep more of their profits, so that the loans have greater impact in reducing poverty.</p>","kiva, microfinance, microcredit, p2p-microlending, micro-finance, micro-credit, microfinancing",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0020/2182/202182v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0020/2182/202182v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0020/2182/202182v2-max-450x450.png,20,,

<p>The idea for Zoodles was born while Mark watched his 4-year-old daughter, Abbie, struggle while using the computer. He wondered why kids were constantly trying to adapt to computers rather than having the computers adapt to them. After talking with dozens of other parents, it became clear that they were all equally frustrated with the experiences their children were having online.</p>
<p>While parents universally believed that the computer could help their kids learn, they just didn’t have the time or resources to scour the web and find any of this fun, educational content themselves. Additionally, parents wanted more say over what their children were doing online. Without trusted content, they really didn’t want to open up the whole, sometimes scary, web to their young kids.</p>
<p>Mark decided it was time to build a safe, fun, and educational online experience for kids that also gave parents the information and control they wanted. After discussing the idea with his friend, Rich, they decided to form a company to build Zoodles. â€¨</p>
<p>Since then, the team has grown to include incredibly talented engineers, educational experts, and creative designers who understand how to build simple interfaces for kids. The team is excited to be working on a product that can change how children learn while giving parents an active role in the experience. We hope that you enjoy Zoodles as much as we do! â€¨ </p>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0007/7000/77000v6-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0007/7000/77000v6-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0007/7000/77000v6-max-450x450.png, ,37.3927975,-122.0727749

<p>Zopa works in the following way: the company first categorizes borrower credit grades with an A*, A, B, C or Y rating; then lenders make offers that vary by money amount and time period for persons with a certain credit grade; and borrowers can then agree the aggregate offered rate.</p>
<p>Zopa takes on such responsibilities as distributing money between parties, completing the legal paperwork, performing borrower identity/credit checks, and employing a collections agency that chases missed payments for the lender.</p>
<p>Zopa also mitigates risk for lenders by enforcing monthly direct debit repayment, making borrowers sign a legal contract, and allowing lenders to lend small chunks of money to individual borrowers (i.e. someone lending Â£1000 would have their money spread across say 100 borrowers).</p>
<p>The company itself makes money by charging a fixed fee for borrowers and 1% annual fee for lenders.</p>
<p>Zopa has received public acclaim as well, having been awarded CNET Technology Awards’ 2006 Internet Innovation of the Year, the 2007 Webby Award for Best Banking/Bill-Paying Website, the 2008 Webby Award for Financial Services, the Banker 2007 Award for Best Internet Project and Moneywise 2009 Awards for Best Customer Service and Best Personal Loan.</p>

Companies can link their profiles with others to demonstrate the depth and quality of their business network and to identify the shared relationships they have with potential customers and vendors, thereby providing value to both buyers and sellers.

<p>A space for internal collaboration and communication, file management, tasks, contacts… all in a single platform. Integrated with all the company’s corporate management systems, with complete personalization and customization options, including commercialization as a white label product, available as a cloud-hosted (public or private) or on-premises solution.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Zyncro is an Enterprise Social Network, a private work environment for sharing information confidentially and securely, containing a social microblogging system, a document repository, a task manager, and a professional contact agenda. </p>
<p>Zyncro integrates with the leading business management tools:
  *SharePoint
  *ERPs, such as SAP
  *BI systems (Pentaho, Google Analytics) and CRMs
  *Project management tools, like Doolphy
  *Google Apps: Gmail, Calendar and Drive
  *Social Networks: LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, RSS and YouTube
  *Other corporate web applications: Evernote, SurveyMonkey
  *With any web content generator…</p>
<p>Zyncro uses social technology to enable organizations to:</p>
<p>*optimize and reduce email use
  *improve internal knowledge retainment and management
  *make teamwork more efficient
  *motivate and involve employees in the corporate mission
  *provide access to corporate information and documents.</p>
<p>As well as being an enterprise social network, Zyncro can act as a Private Social Network, a space for collaboration and communication, perfect for any organization looking to build private social relationship with its customers, suppliers or partners… where contents and information generated do not belong to third parties (unlike Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn) but to the users.</p>
<p>Zyncro also has a multi-organization structure, making it a ideal solution not only for single enterprises, but for groups and business communities looking for a common space to share information, news, files, contacts and applications.</p>
<p>The original Zyncro idea back in 2008 in the Grupo Inspirit technology laboratory consisted in creating a files synchronizer that would allow and individual to access all of their professional and personal documents “in the cloud”.  Nonetheless, upon seeing the potential that this tool could have within a company, a more corporate approach was given to it each time.  At the same time, the “surname” social and the 2.0 style was inundating the Internet and it was then that the decision was taken to add collaborative and communicative functionalities to it that later converted it to what it is today: an intranet 2.0 or company social network.  This part of Zyncro‘s trajectory is what Didac Lee, founder of Grupo Inspirit, considers the a “Journey accross the desert”, which all startups must endure.  Thanks to the appointment of Luis Font as Zyncro CEO in November 2010, the business strategy and product definition became polished and sales and marketing departments were consolidated until we became what we are today.  And still on the uprise! </p>","microblogging, hybrid-file-server, cloud-computing, enterprise-2-0, file-collaboration, all-in-one, social-business, innovation, enterprise-social-network",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0009/0749/90749v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0009/0749/90749v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0009/0749/90749v2-max-450x450.png,200,,
