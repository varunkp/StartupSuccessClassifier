Users can upload, print, and share photos with friends. Printing photos is Snapfishâ€™s main focus for the site. This is a different focus than most photo sharing and storage sites that usually have a strong focus on the community aspect, like Flickr.</p>
<p>Snapfish has even partnered with retail stores like Costco and Walgreens so you can pick up your prints locally. Users can also easily create gifts, photo books and cards using their photos.</p>
<p>Users are encouraged to upload as many photos as they want since they have unlimited uploads. However, to keep unlimited upload status users are required to buy prints at least once every year or their photos will be deleted. This is easy to get around since you can buy a single print for around $0.12.</p>

<p>Fanning, Mendelson and Conway founded SNOCAP in the days immediately following Napsterâ€™s demise. Many of the companyâ€™s employees, including its COO, <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/person/ali-aydar"" title=""Ali Aydar"">Ali Aydar</a>, were veterans of the original Napster team.</p>
<p>SNOCAPâ€™s initial focus was on developing technology content owners (in particular artists and labels) could use to register their content and set business rules controlling where and how that content is available on the web. SNOCAP eventually secured deals with all four major labels (Universal Music Group, EMI, Warner Music Group, and SonyBMG Music Entertainment) to register their content in SNOCAPâ€™s digital registry. </p>
<p>SNOCAPâ€™s ultimate goal was to license this technology to file-sharing services, enabling a new wave of â€œlegal P2Pâ€ù services that used SNOCAPâ€™s technology to track and filter music sharing within a network, blocking registered content that labels &amp; artists didnâ€™t want shared but allowing sharing of anything else. While two file-sharing services, Mashboxx and Grokster, signed up to use SNOCAPâ€™s technology, their SNOCAP-powered services never launched.</p>
<p>In late 2006, SNOCAP and <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/myspace"" title=""MySpace"">MySpace</a> announced that they were partnering to give independent artists and labels a way to sell music on MySpace through SNOCAPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s MyStore widgets. Eventually, over 110,000 artists signed up to sell their music through MyStore widgets. These early experiments were a precursor to MySpaceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s efforts to sell downloads directly to consumers through its <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/myspace-music"" title=""MySpace Music"">MySpace Music</a> venture. </p>
<p>In March 2007, SNOCAP announced it was partnering with the social media site <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/imeem"" title=""imeem"">imeem</a> to track music being played on the site and share ad revenue with artists and labels, utilizing SNOCAPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s content fingerprinting and digital registry technology. The goal was to provide a way for consumers to upload and share music with their friends, for free, and to do so in a way where label and artists can both make money and have greater control over where and how their music was available. imeem rolled out this new offering in June 2007.</p>
<p>In April 2008, imeem acquired SNOCAP, confirming rumors first reported on TechCrunch two months earlier. That acquisition reunited several members of the original Napster team, including SNOCAPâ€™s then COO, Ali Aydar, who is now imeemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s COO. Aydar was a key early advisor to imeem and served on its board of directors from 2003-2007.</p>
<p>imeem continues to operate the SNOCAP digital registry, and uses the technology acquired from SNOCAP to power imeemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ad-supported streaming music service.</p>
<p>SNOCAP was backed by Ron Conway, Morgenthaler Ventures, WaldenVC, and Court Square Ventures. In total, the company raised over $25 million in funding from WaldenVC, Morgenthaler Ventures, and Court Square Ventures.</p></body></html>","musicdistribution, p2p, imeem, al-aydar, shawn-fanning, napster, myspace, myspace-music, fingerprinting, content-management, dalton-caldwell",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0000/4297/4297v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0000/4297/4297v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0000/4297/4297v1-max-450x450.png, ,,47,/company/snoobe,Snoobe,http://www.snoobe.com,mobile,"390,000",operating,USA,,United States - Other,,2,2/1/12, 2012-02 ,2012-Q1,2012,2/10/13,10/25/13,6/1/13,"<html><body><p>Snoobe is a patent-pending platform that combines the practicality of a smartphone app with the strength of a powerful comparison, recommendation and lead management engine.

<li><p>Trading Indicator API
Multiple studies over the past years have shown that Twitter sentiment can be used as an indicator for future stock price movement. The trading indicator gives hourly and/or daily buy &amp; sell signals for all S&amp;P 500 stocks based on online sentiment on Twitter. The stock price predictions are based upon various machine learning algorithms and have an accuracy as high as 60 percent with an average of 54 percent. The predictions take away extra noise in asset pricing, and can be used by investors as an additional trading indicator on top of fundamental analysis and technical analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Financial Sentiment API
Sentiment is hard to classify in financially themed Twitter messages, mainly because financial markets speak their own language of fear and greed. The Financial Sentiment API is specifically trained to deal with unstructured context and financial jargon, and has an accuracy of 84.3% on a binary scale and an accuracy of 76.8% on a three point scale. </p></li>
<li><p>Brand Sentiment API
Classify sentiment in social media messages surrounding brands. The algorithm is specifically tailored to brands, products &amp; company information. It has an accuracy of 84.7% on a binary scale and an accuracy of 86.9% on a three point scale. </p></li>

Social Bicycles designs bike share bicycles, equipment and software. The company offers all of their customers (municipal, institutional, and commercial markets) bike share operations training and technical support. </p>
<p>SoBi pioneered an innovative â€œsmart bikeâ€ù approach using an integrated GPS-enabled lock that works with affordable bike racks. This new paradigm is shifting the bike sharing equipment industry, providing more flexible fleet management for operators and richer features for bike share program members while reducing overall operating costs.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Ryan Rzepecki in New York City. As an urban planner and project manager for the New York City Department of Transportationâ€™s bike program, Ryan watched as bike share systems began spread around the globe. He loved the concept but felt that infrastructure costs needed to be reduced in order for bike share to be financially sustainable. He identified one of the core problems, expensive smart-dock infrastructure, and set out to change the industry by using mobile technology to deliver a more affordable and advanced alternative.</p>
<p>SoBi technology continues to improve with advanced features from the tech industry to provide software and hardware that achieves cost reductions and efficiency gains. These unique features have fueled the companyâ€™s explosive growth and changed the landscape of the bike share industry.</p></body></html>","bikeshare, bike-share, bike-sharing, transportation, last-mile, m2m, iot, social, bicycles, alternate-transportation",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0010/9487/109487v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0010/9487/109487v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0010/9487/109487v2-max-450x450.png,11,,87,/company/social-collective,Social Collective,http://thesocialcollective.com,social,"20,000",closed,USA,VA,Washington DC,Arlington,1,4/17/09, 2009-04 ,2009-Q2,2009,4/18/09,4/18/09,11/16/09,"<html><body><p>The Social Collective provides a hosted service that gives conference organizers their own mini-<a href=""/company/facebook"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Facebook"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""/company/twitter"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Twitter"">Twitter</a>.</p>

Another feature, DJ, allows everyone in the room to bump with one device and crowd-source the next playlist.   Many of these activities add to the userâ€™s point history.

<p>Why SocialDiabetes? So far, diabetes has been considered as something personal and nontransferable. We think itâ€™s time for a change. How? Taking advantage of the knowledge that we, diabetic patients, have on our own disease and sharing it through this application.</p>
<p>The application has the aim of improving your autonomy, flexibility and risk control, providing you with an aid in the self-management of both food intake and insulin dose administration.</p>
<p>Taking into account the insulin guidelines prescribed by your doctor, you can introduce several variables into the system that will alter the optimum dose you need to inject yourself. Thus you will gain freedom and self-confidence in daily life, in every issue related to the disease. The system is also capable of avoiding hypoglycaemias during the night, the most dangerous for a diabetic person, by recommending you to have a snack before going to bed if this is the case, and letting you know the exact equivalence in carbohydrates of the intake. This is achieved through an intelligent system implemented within the application suited to learn your reaction to food intake and to the administered insulin dose.</p>
<p>SocialDiabetes allow your doctor manage the control of your diabetes remotely thanks to statistics, evolutive analysis, alert management and messages between the management web and your mobile device. There are outstanding advantages: saving time and money, and avoiding inconveniences in your daily life.</p></body></html>","diabetes, social, mobile, health, blood, glucometer",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0020/6160/206160v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0020/6160/206160v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0020/6160/206160v2-max-450x450.png,4,,134,/company/socialdial,SocialDial,http://socialdial.com,messaging,"1,000,000",closed,USA,CA,SF Bay,Pleasanton,1,1/1/12, 2012-01 ,2012-Q1,2012,4/1/12,4/1/12,,"<html><body><p>Socialdial, Inc. is a next generation communications company that produces several products for mobile and web platforms.</p></body></html>",conference-call-public-spealomg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0020/8339/208339v2-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0020/8339/208339v2-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0020/8339/208339v2-max-450x450.jpg,5,,135,/company/socialears,SocialEars,http://www.socialears.com,enterprise,"200,000",operating,USA,CA,SF Bay,Aptos,1,2/7/12, 2012-02 ,2012-Q1,2012,8/23/12,8/23/12,2/7/12,"<html><body><p>SocialEars is a radically different approach to social listening software.

As a P2P lender, SocietyOne connects savvy investors and creditworthy borrowers in a way that is cheaper, faster and more efficient.</p>
<p>SocietyOne enables individuals to lend and borrow money to each other without the intermediation of a bank or financial institution. Qualified borrowers can request up to $30,000 in unsecured personal loans at competitive rates determined by their credit history. Approved applications are listed on the platform for verified investors to assess and bid on. Once terms are agreed and accepted by the parties, SocietyOne handles the funds management and servicing of every loan on behalf of the matched borrowers and investors. Stringent procedures and processes ensure a safe and secure lending environment.</p>
<p>Our philosophy is to exploit the structural mispricing and operating inefficiencies that exist in the traditional banking sector to bring borrowers and investors better rates. We are unencumbered by the branch infrastructure, overhead and capital reserve requirements that drive up operating costs for traditional banks and believe our proprietary ClearMatch technology platform allows us to radically reduce the cost of originating, servicing, and funding of traditional loans.  </p>
<p>This means that we are able to pass the savings on to investors and borrowers alike by sharing our lower operating cost advantage.  Qualifying borrowers with good credit history and strong capacity to repay get access to cheaper loans while investors have the opportunity to lock in more attractive rates of return. â€¨â€¨</p>

<p>Innovators like the World Bank, Medicare, Data.gov, EnergyStar, New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Oregon and Maryland, have all chosen Socrata for its turnkey and low-cost cloud delivery of easy-to-use open data products.</p>
<p>Socrataâ€™s toolkit goes well beyond creating data catalogues. The companyâ€™s products are designed to support a lively ecosystem around open data.</p>
<p>For example, every data set on Socrata is API-enabled with accompanying documentation, allowing developers and entrepreneurs to query data sets easily to create apps. Meanwhile, citizens, researchers, and journalists can search for the information they want without filling out a F.O.I.A. request or digging through papers. They can easily create digital visualizations, such as map mashups, charts, and graphs, with data. These same citizens then embed their creations on another website, where the data included will refresh automatically. And, they can give feedback to the agency hosting the data about their experience, creating a full feedback loop between citizens and government.</p>
<p>In addition, Socrata GovStat combines openly accessible government data and a drag-and-drop report-creation tool, Socrata DataSlate, to offer an efficient way for government agencies to track their progress against goals and engage with the public about the results. Designed by former Director of Maryland StateStat, Beth Blauer, GovStat is transforming the cost and effectiveness of government performance management.</p></body></html>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0007/0719/70719v7-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0007/0719/70719v7-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0007/0719/70719v7-max-450x450.png, ,,196,/company/socrates-health-solutions,Socrates Health Solutions,http://socrateshealthsolutions.com,hardware,"1,285,000",operating,USA,TX,Dallas,Dallas,1,,,,,12/12/13,12/12/13,,"<html><body><p>Socrates Health Solutions is headquarted in Dallas, Texas and is a Delaware based corporation.

<p>Sodraft is a Vancouver based technology startup which aims to enter the dynamic fantasy Sports Market through the development of a social drafting simulator. This simulator has transformed the traditional serpentine draft into a robust online platform which empowers its users to draft a single team and directly compete with an unlimited number of competitors; all without compromising the integrity of the draft or user experience. Essentially, this is the first and only platform which has successfully re-imagined the traditional draft into a truly social platform. With 1 in 9 Americans participating in fantasy sports leagues, and significant growth for fantasy sports around the globe, Sodraft aims to become the primary social platform for Fantasy Sports world-wide. </p>
<p>The X-Draft simulator (US Provisional Patent) combines a traditional serpentine draft with a tiered-path picking system, producing over 16 trillion unique team combinations. Membership and participation with Sodraft is completely free, and all users will be automatically enrolled to compete in the main fantasy league for each sport in which they draft a team. These users will then be eligible for a variety of weekly and seasonal cash prizes. In addition to the â€œHouse Leagueâ€ù, a â€œGroupsâ€ù function will allow users to create their own private leagues, or join public leagues for Colleges, Cities, States and Countries. This will increase their prize contention, while also giving users the ability to socially compete against as many or as few users as they like. With very few innovations to seasonal fantasy sports games since its online inception, industry leaders have been scrambling to develop new ways to retain existing users and attract new comers. Sodraft is confident the X-Draft is the innovation the fantasy sports industry needs to re-engage the veterans and entice potential new players.    </p>
<p>Sodraft has has developed a fully functional beta version, and will run an Indiegogo campaign to try and raise funds to cover hosting and licensing fees for to launch for the 2013 NFL season. </p></body></html>","fantasy-sports, sports, social-networking",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0028/9314/289314v2-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0028/9314/289314v2-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0028/9314/289314v2-max-450x450.jpg,7,49.2755037,-123.124831207,/company/soevolved,Soevolved,http://soevolved.com,social,"500,000",operating,,,unknown,,1,1/1/11, 2011-01 ,2011-Q1,2011,7/30/12,7/30/12,,"<html><body><p>icangowithout exists to empower and assist this force, by providing tools to create sustainable positive impacts on local and international levels. </p></body></html>","mobile, ventures, good, charity",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0036/6638/366638v1-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0036/6638/366638v1-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0036/6638/366638v1-max-450x450.jpg,10, , 208,/company/sofa-labs,Sofa Labs,http://thread.com,social,"1,200,000",operating,USA,CA,SF Bay,San Mateo,2,1/1/09, 2009-01 ,2009-Q1,2009,5/1/09,9/1/09,9/1/09,"<html><body><p>Sofa Labs is a developer of social applications.

<p>If you qualify, Solmentum installs solar panels on your roof. Because of recent energy programs at both the State and the Federal level, this process requires only a minimal upgrade fee.

<p>Since its inception, Solmentum has provided this peace of mind to more than 1,000 happy homeowners in the form of over 5MW of electricity.

<p>SoMoLend is the first of its kind in many ways as a fully transparent portal that allows investors to look into the eyes of business borrowers in their own neighborhood before making any lending decisions. With SoMo, individuals, banks, local governments, business associations, chambers of commerce and municipalities can invest in small businesses by use of a safe, secure, easy-to-use platform. SoMo is designed with the capability of allowing and promoting peer-to-peer lending, by which business borrowers can get loans from friends and family, customers, Twitter followers, Facebook friends and LinkedIn connections. SoMo will launch peer-to-peer lending nationwide in 2013.</p>
<p>In 2010 the founder of SoMoLend, Candace Klein, began a micro-lending program matched with a womenâ€™s only, training-based program for participants to earn funding for their start-up companies. There were start-ups that were not able to attain funding through this specific program, and it became apparent that small businesses everywhere needed an advocate. The idea for SoMoLend came from this realization and the desire to assist start-ups that were not able to gain funding through the program.</p>
<p>SoMoLend was founded in 2011 to serve small businesses that are not being served by traditional funding. SoMoLend was created on the principal of communities and people helping each other out: people investing in people. We strive as a company to assist local businesses, help entrepreneurs to grow, and allow lenders to invest in the companies and ideas they believe in most. Small businesses create jobs and support local communities, but are struggling to get the support they need; this is where SoMoLend steps in! </p></body></html>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0018/9946/189946v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0018/9946/189946v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0018/9946/189946v1-max-450x450.png,5,,377,/company/somonic-solutions,Somonic Solutions,http://somonic.com,hardware,,operating,DEU,,Dresden,Dresden,1,11/1/12, 2012-11 ,2012-Q4,2012,9/16/13,9/16/13,,"<html><body><p>Somonic Solutions GmbH, a Dresden, Germany-based developer of process measuring instrument for electroplating technology.</p></body></html>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0032/7444/327444v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0032/7444/327444v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0032/7444/327444v1-max-450x450.png, ,,378,/company/soms-technologies,SOMS Technologies,http://www.microgreenfilter.com,cleantech,"500,000",operating,USA,NY,New York,Valhalla,2,,,,,6/13/08,12/3/08,,"<html><body><p>SOMS Technologies produces the MicroGreen Engine Filter.

After many experiments in the last months weâ€™ve been able to DOUBLE the attendance by developing: 
Crowdsourced booking process: fans vote which band plays. 
Attendance prediction: We analyze voters and other data to help the organizer book the right band. 
Benefits list: Fans can access to benefits if they register to the list through a Facebook account and share the event. 
Check-in: Attendees are checked-in through a mobile app when entering the show. This makes possible to generate analytics about how many people attracted each band, among other analytics. 
Benefit validation: A mobile app is used to validate the people that has benefits.</p>

<p>The goal of Sookbox is to empower users to enjoy their media on whatever device they choose, from the palm of their hand. At Sookbox, media access is organized by user, rather than by device or service.</p>
<p>Devices should do what they are best at doing. Movies should be watched on a television, not a laptop. Music should be listened to through an amp and speakers, not computer speakers. And the remote control for everything should be a smartphone or tablet. The problem is that communication between these media outlets is difficult and onerous.</p>
<p>Sookbox gives a cross-platform universal solution that goes beyond putting a smart app on a smart TV. Sookbox breaks from traditional thinking in two crucial ways: First is to put a cloud into homes, and the second is to serve content and controls separately.</p>
<p>Sookbox provides a novel type of cloud service. The Sookbox uses stored or streamed content. It allows users to have their own physical server in their homes. This server, the Sookbox, allows a user to store content in their own â€œpersonal cloud.â€ù That is music, digital movies, and pictures on a single server. This idea is not unique, but it is powerfully packaged: media storage, distribution, and control - all centralized and layered in a single device. That gives you the power to use your iPhone to click â€œGoodfellas. Basement TV.â€ù</p>
<p>The core of the product line, the software of the cloud server, is a revolutionary type of web application development platform known as Harmony.  The current paradigm is a world where content and controls are in the same place. For example, the YouTube video controls are right next to the video and the back button is across the browser. Sookbox transcends that paradigm. Televisions are best for video, speakers are best for sound, and handheld devices are best for control. Now that Sookbox divides the cloud by user, it makes sense to serve multiple, different sites from a single web app.</p>
<p>A fundamental Sookbox feature is that it does not compete with other cloud services or try to debunk them. Instead, it gives them a platform and a vessel to reach their current users in a friendlier, more powerful way. Harmony unleashes applications such as Pandora, Netflix and YouTube across a userâ€™s home. For example, someone might want to develop a â€œPandora Alarm Clockâ€ù app. The API allows developers to provide a single, connective user experience synchronized across multiple types of devices. On the developersâ€™ side, the Harmony libraries and structure allow them to serve independently content to content device(s) and controls to controlling device(s). By facilitating this two-way communication, Sookbox allows the navigation of media, the play/pause, volume, etc. to be displayed graphically on the handheld device and directly control the music coming out of the speakers.</p>
<p>Sookbox can be viewed as a personal cloud. Personal meaning the user owns it personally, but also it is personalized. The cloud should be divided by user, not by device or by service. Sookbox opens a new layer between the other cloud services and the user that makes the experience personal and meaningful.</p></body></html>","connective-computing, video, music, controls, content, cloud, networking",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0019/9046/199046v4-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0019/9046/199046v4-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0019/9046/199046v4-max-450x450.jpg,7,42.3736158,-71.1097335427,/company/sooligan,Sooligan,http://www.Sooligan.com,web,"15,000",operating,USA,CA,SF Bay,Berkeley,2,1/1/12, 2012-01 ,2012-Q1,2012,11/8/12,12/14/12,6/1/13,"<html><body><p>Smart students, smart cities.

<p>Todayâ€™s internet users solve problems, develop skills and educate themselves through reading, researching, or watching videos on YouTube and other how-to type websites. Unfortunately for these users, the internet is filled with generic answers for generic questions.

<p>By catering to three unique user-typesÃ¢â‚¬â€ùreporter, expert and PR proÃ¢â‚¬â€ùSourceYourCity seeks to create a better experience for both the report and expert/PR user than current competitors provide. This is accomplished by delivering relevant opportunities to experts based on both topic and location, while giving reporters access to a targeted professional community that delivers better source referrals in a manageable volume.</p>
<p>SourceYourCity is led by Founder, President Neely Burks.</p>

BoomTimeâ€™s initial services include robust Instant Gift Certificate functionality, Dynamic Websites, and an Appointment Request feature.</p>
<p>Service-based companies have been traditionally under-served on the Internet, since itâ€™s difficult to â€œbuy a massageâ€ùÂù over the Internet.  Given that the service-based sector is the largest sector in the US and world economies, and general public acceptance of the Internet for business transactions has steadily increased over the years, SpaBoom is well positioned for growth.</p>
<p>SpaBoom is one of several brands the company uses to reach niche markets. The other brands are <a href=""www.coverboom.com"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""CoverBoom"">CoverBoom</a> and <a href=""www.boomtime.com"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""BoomTime"">BoomTime</a>, for restaurants and the horizontal market, respectively.</p>
<p>SpaBoom first tested the concept of Instant Gift Certificates with spas and salons, due to the perceived importance of gift certificates (up to 30% of their business) and Internet leads to these organizations. It was discovered that almost one-half of gift certificate purchasers wait to buy until the last 48 hours of a holiday or event. Providing an instant gift capability has allowed SpaBoom customers to greatly increase their sales by catering to the last-minute purchaser, where the delays associated with manual fulfillment and/or postal mail is nonexistent.</p>
<p>In 2006, SpaBoom started work on a distribution model, that enables it to sell the Instant Gift Certificates of its clients and push the inventory of Instant Gift Certificates to other distribution networks. SpaEmergency (www.spaemergency.com) was formed in 2006 to sell Spa and Salon Instant Gift Certificates, and a strategic relationship with Zagat Survey (www.zagat.com) was formed in 2008 for its CoverBoom clients.</p>
<p>By July, 2008, SpaBoom boasts over 10% of the Spa market with 2,600 spas and salons in North America. It is anticipated that CoverBoom will boast over 1,000 restaurants by the end of 2008.</p></body></html>","gift, gift-certificate, gift-certificates, e-commerce, service, email, web-hosting, dynamic-website",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/0125/20125v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/0125/20125v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/0125/20125v1-max-450x450.png,12,35.086388,-106.646185526,/company/space-adventures,Space Adventures,http://www.spaceadventures.com,travel,,operating,USA,VA,Washington DC,Vienna,1,1/1/98, 1998-01 ,1998-Q1,1998,10/1/08,10/1/08,1/1/97,"<html><body><p>Space Adventures is an aerospace company that is focused on space tourism.

It is developing the partially reusable launch vehicles Falcon 1 and Falcon 9. Originally based in El Segundo, SpaceX now operates out of Hawthorne, California, USA.</p>
<p>SpaceX was founded in June 2002 by Musk who had invested $100 million of his own money in the company as of March 2006. In January 2005, SpaceX bought a 10% stake in Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.</p>
<p>SpaceX had 160 employees in November 2005, and more than 500 by July 2008. The launch crew in the Marshall Islands has 25 people, 6 in mission control. This small number, compared to similar space launch companies, is part of cost reduction. Musk sees other space-launch servicesâ€™ high prices as supporting unnecessary bureaucracy. Heâ€™s stated that one of his goals is to improve the cost and reliability of access to space by a factor of ten.</p>
<p>Elon Musk stated after the failure of the third Falcon 1 flight attempt, â€œAs a precautionary measure to guard against the possibility of flight 3 not reaching orbit, SpaceX recently accepted a significant investment. Combined with our existing cash reserves, that ensures we will have more than sufficient funding on hand to continue launching Falcon 1 and develop Falcon 9 and Dragonâ€ù; on August 4, SpaceX released further details; they had accepted a USD$20 million equity investment from the Founderâ€™s Fund.</p>
<p>Founded in 2002, the SpaceX team now numbers over 500, located primarily in Hawthorne, California, with four additional locations: SpaceXâ€™s Texas Test Facility in McGregor near Waco; offices in Washington DC; and launch facilities at Cape Canaveral, Florida, and the Marshall Islands in the Central Pacific.</p></body></html>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0008/0305/80305v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0008/0305/80305v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0008/0305/80305v1-max-450x450.png,1746,,530,/company/space-monkey,Space Monkey,http://spacemonkey.com,network_hosting,"2,250,000",operating,USA,UT,Salt Lake City,Midvale,1,7/1/11, 2011-07 ,2011-Q3,2011,7/12/12,7/12/12,4/1/13,"<html><body><p>Space Monkey is an affordable subscription-based data storage solution that is taking the cloud out of the datacenter, creating a faster and more durable way to store data from any device.

Sparkbrowser is currently in the development stage, and is closed source as far as contributions.  In late 2010 Sparkbrowser has merged with Spark Software Group, as well as Free Software Group to combine efforts to launch the browser in August.  As there is an exteremely untapped market as far as browsers go, Sparkbrowser is a pioneer in its respective field.  Making leaps ahead of the competition as the only marketed For Profit premium web browser.  </p>
<p>Sparkbrowser was founded under the principles set forth by the Netscape project, that software should be paid for. And that generally, for profit software is better quality as there are greater resources available, and more attention can be paid to detail.  </p>
<p>Sparkbrowser has met many challenges over the past several months, however in anticipation of the launch in mid August we would like to apologize for the wait as this browser was expected to launch in march.  </p>
<p>We can honestly say that it has been worth the wait!<br/>
The new browser is faster, and provides a preferred view of the web with new pre-fetching code to ignite speed and agility.  As well as a redesigned SSL encryption script.  </p>

<p>In 2013, we as leaders are making business decisions the same old way: we gather input from trusted advisors and make the call. We fail to systematically capture employee feedback, even if we value it, because it is a manual process and itâ€™s time consuming. We are missing great ideas and creativity from our best staff at all levels of the organization, especially the ones that arenâ€™t brave enough to proactively approach us. Systemic issues in the business remain unsolved, crucial market opportunities are not brought to light, and most employees have a transactional relationship with the company - input work hours, output a salary - with varying degrees of loyalty. For too many of our staff, they donâ€™t get the satisfaction of seeing their ideas come to fruition, which results in a missing emotional connection to the company and itâ€™s mission.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s not just a problem, itâ€™s an epidemic. Only 13% of global employees are engaged at work. Why? Because we havenâ€™t found a way to truly engage them. Surveys and all-hands meetings donâ€™t cut it. The talent within an organization is its most valuable asset, but only if they are personally invested in the companyâ€™s success. Worldwide R&amp;D spending in 2011 reached $603B, and yet only $720M was invested in employee engagement. 21st century companies will be defined by how well they optimize and automate their operations, especially when it comes to innovating. Which begs the question: How many untapped product ideas and market opportunities are consuming the thoughts (but not the words or actions) of a modern day employee?</p>
<p>SpeakUp gives every member of a company the power to post a problem, propose a solution to an existing problem, or simply share a great idea. Via the dashboard, leaders are presented with the teamâ€™s top solutions and ideas and can transparently â€œapprove,â€ù â€œamend,â€ù or â€œdenyâ€ù posts. Employees can see that their input is influencing company decisions, and leaders benefit from the ideas and problem solving skills from those that know the company best: their employees. The positive feedback loop that results from leaders implementing employee ideas means more engaged teams and improved products and processes.</p></body></html>","human-resource-automation, b2b, saas, human-resources",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0038/2672/382672v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0038/2672/382672v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0038/2672/382672v2-max-450x450.png,4,,608,/company/speakworks,SpeakWorks,http://speakworks.com,analytics,"624,999",operating,USA,UT,Salt Lake City,Orem,2,1/1/11, 2011-01 ,2011-Q1,2011,7/16/12,10/8/13,,"<html><body><p>SpeakWorks, Inc. develops a video coaching and feedback system for educational and professional organizations.
