<p>Through effective lead generation, qualification and execution, The Good Mortgage Company aims to remove 50% of the origination costs for mortgage companies.

The Company’s value proposition is based upon providing lenders with a significantly lower cost alternative to their own direct marketing channels. The Good Mortgage Company’s efficiency is underpinned by true whole of market mortgage lender coverage; the quality of its leads; proprietary online systems; and an FSA regulated and professional call centre.</p>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0008/9013/89013v3-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0008/9013/89013v3-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0008/9013/89013v3-max-450x450.png, ,,

Start by uploading “master” movie files to your account. Once uploaded a preview film is automatically created and the movie shows up in the List View. Clicking the movie to make it active allows you to perform various functions like previewing, downloading encoded versions or attaching detailed meta data - this makes it very search-able within the database you create. One can also assign Access to other users so the database is shared. For companies with large amounts of films this is a very convenient way to share info and organize across the net.
Previews videos can be securely sent via email links.
Once a file is in your Library you can chose to download it from a variety of encoding pre-sets designed for cinema, television, mobile devices, digital signage, web and the original source file. Now anyone can encode like a pro.
Film companies and commercial agencies use The Library to store master files digitally rather than having their master tapes stored all over the place. By sending upload links to all these locations, it makes it easy to gather all the masters into The Library you start to build. Files can quickly be shared with previews and download links.
Large companies use it to organize all their filmed media so that it’s easily accessible from anywhere by anyone with a web-friendly device. 24 / 7
The Library was inspired by an editor who saw the inefficiency of the existing system, which, while it had gone digital, was still lacking in many areas. The system eliminates the use of external technicians to process files, removes the cumbersome use of FTP and eliminates tapes and couriers. It increases productivity and improves the efficiency of the people charged with managing media files.</p>","digital, video, management, uncompressed, mastering, encoding, downloading, previewing, uploading",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0017/3793/173793v2-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0017/3793/173793v2-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0017/3793/173793v2-max-450x450.jpg,3,,

<p>TIP investigate these key sectors by conducting comprehensive interviews within the extensive network that it has developed and which is comprised of the worldâ€™s largest buyers and users of IT.  Today, the TIPNetwork is in excess of 1,800  key IT decision-makers, spanning 900 companies, with the bulk of these organizations being Global 2000 enterprises, representing billions of dollars in spending power.

The result was an evolution of the traditional expert/analyst model into TIPâ€™s proprietary peer-to-peer approach in the IT research space.  In addition, he realized that investors were being forced to look elsewhere for pure data on the different vendors, technologies, and market trends, given the well documented bias in sell-side research.  Since its inception, TIP has established itself as the research standard for the IT sectors it studies.</p>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0003/4204/34204v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0003/4204/34204v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0003/4204/34204v1-max-450x450.png, , ,

The Company’s platform automates the capture and conversion of sales channel data across the enterprise into actionable key performance indicators (KPIs) presented in highly visual and interactive dashboards.</p>
<p>While most existing BI / analytics platforms are typically used by corporate managers to gain visibility into business unit performance, they are often limited in their ability to provide visibility beyond the channel partner or distributor level (e.g., national or regional dealer). They are further limited in their ability to provide tools to influence or motivate performance at the individual salesperson level (e.g., sales associate at dealer).</p>
<p>ThinkSmart’s unique analytics and reporting capabilities allow its clients to track real-time sales data at point-of-sale (POS) / individual salesperson level, and standardize the use and analysis of that data by various constituents across an entire organization. ThinkSmart also provides employee management and communication tools to track and incentivize sales performance at the individual level.</p>
<p>The Company’s platform is especially vital for large organizations with disparate sales channels or distribution partners where access to end customer data can be challenging. ThinkSmart’s clients are typically large global organizations conducting sales activity through multiple local distributors or retail storefronts where headquarters has limited influence over individual sales performance. </p>","saas, enterprise, channel, sales, reporting, analytics, incentives",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0029/9115/299115v2-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0029/9115/299115v2-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0029/9115/299115v2-max-450x450.jpg,90,,

As many Digg clones and alternative models are failing or have failed to take hold of a substantial user base, Thoof brings a slightly new take on getting your daily stories which it hopes will attract more than a niche audience.  Thoof is an automated news recommender of sorts.  It works similarly to many music recommendation engines such as <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/last.fm"" title=""Last.fm"">Last.fm</a> and <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/pandora"" title=""Pandora"">Pandora</a>, by displaying articles you might like based upon your past reading history.  Readers submit articles in a Digg-like fashion, but don’t vote to get the articles on the front page.  Founder Ian Clarke, formerly of video site <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/revver"" title=""Revver"">Revver</a>, claims that with video as well as news, many people may read articles but few will vote on them.  Clarke hints that the passivity of news and video consumption may ultimately weed out news aggregators that cannot automatically deliver customized news.  However, Thoof users are allowed to edit the news by suggesting alternative links.  If link changes are to stand they must get enough votes from the rest of the community. Thoof has many web 2.0 elements including article tagging, wiki features and aforementioned recommendation engine.  It isn’t an exact clone of any one social news site, but can be considered a competitor to sites like <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/digg"" title=""Digg"">Digg</a>, <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/netscape"" title=""Netscape"">Netscape</a> and <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/y-combinator"" title=""Y Combinator"">Y Combinator</a> company <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/reddit"" title=""Reddit"">Reddit</a>.</p>",social-news,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0000/4462/4462v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0000/4462/4462v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0000/4462/4462v1-max-450x450.png, ,30.268735,-97.745209

<p>Thoora was created after founders Chul Lee, Kyu Lee and Byron Ma realized there wasn’t a service to effectively aggregate traditional and social media content into a single source. The Thoora engine was based on this premise, and has been refined over the last two years to take that idea a step further: to not just aggregate content, but to discover, rate and deliver the highest-quality, most trusted and relevant content. Thoora explores the entire blogosphere, Twitter, Facebook, other social media apps, and thousands of traditional media sources; and then uses over 100 signals to filter, rank, and deliver that content to our users for their curation.</p>
<p>Thoora’s secret sauce is its unique combination of human and machine. While our aggregation algorithms deliver quality content, we then put our users in the driver’s seat, giving them the tools to refine, re-order, re-rank, and prioritize the content.  The result? Human-curated, topical pages that are always fresh and relevant.</p>
<p>Thoora works as well for businesses and publishers as it does for consumers. Businesses can use it to quickly produce high quality, SEO-friendly vertical content on a broad scale. Consumers can use it to create and share pages on the topics they are passionate about.</p>
<p>Thoora evolved from a research project to a company in 2008 after it agreed to collaborate with Rogers Ventures, which also became an investor. Thoora is currently pushing the envelope by looking at how to intelligently learn from the curation experience to provide better aggregation tools.</p>

<p>Thubit was conceived on the sunny beaches of the Gold Coast, Australia after reflecting on a travel experience to the other side of the world some time ago.. A realization was made that the various services offered by the travel industry are all too segmented and do not lend their way to a positive user experience.</p>
<p>All the effort that goes into organizing a trip, planning a trip, booking a trip and even trying to save the memories of a trip are too segmented from one another, and as such something needs to be done to reduce this complexity from our lives. This is the underlying value Thubit offers.</p>
<p>Stage 1 - Global Event Consolidation</p>
<p>In this first stage, Thubit is now consolidating approx. 5 million events from around the world. NHL is Canada, football in the UK, basketball in the US, we have it all.</p>
<p>Maybe your looking to see an artist in a given city /country i.e Pink In Sydney, Australia or Bruno Mars in Milan, Italy. Well, we have that too along with some of the best tickets available.</p>
<p>Thubit will also show a wide range of free and open events from around the world. Everything from art galleries to conferences, to bike tours, to night clubs. We will do our best to get it all.</p>
<p>The Dreamers</p>
<p>Our group of people are dreamers, visionaries, coders, testers and most importantly travelers. Some of us have large families, while some of us are still living the single life. We are from all corners of the earth which allows us to take a global view to this problem. We have worked for some of the best companies in the world and we have learnt tons from some of the worst. We are a group of talented individuals brought together with a common goal - to simplify the global travel industry.</p>
<p>At Thubit, we dream bigger than the guy next door and our energies go into the practical application of these aspirations.</p>","events, tickets, concerts, travel, mash, artists, travelhub",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0019/4718/194718v12-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0019/4718/194718v12-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0019/4718/194718v12-max-450x450.jpg,9,,

<p>Each project has a specific funding goal and a deadline. Working alongside partners and collaborators, the site uses social media to guide micro-donors to each project to pledge as little as $1 (the default amount) to help that project get off the ground.</p>

<p>Titan’s principal asset is Probuphine®, the first slow-release implant formulation of buprenorphine hydrochloride (“buprenorphine”), designed to maintain a stable, round-the-clock blood level of the medicine in patients for up to six months following a single treatment. The outpatient treatment of opioid dependence with daily dosed sublingual buprenorphine formulations represents a $1.3 billion market in the U.S., and a seven day transdermal patch formulation of buprenorphine for the treatment of chronic pain was launched in the U.S. in 2011. This novel implant formulation is inserted subdermally in a patient’s upper arm providing continuous medication, and has the potential to enhance patient compliance to treatment, and limit diversion for illicit use and accidental exposure to the sublingual formulations. The New Drug Application (NDA) was submitted to the FDA in October, 2012 seeking approval for treatment of opioid dependence. In December 2012, Titan entered into a license agreement with Braeburn Pharmaceuticals Sprl (“Braeburn”) that grants Braeburn exclusive commercialization rights to Probuphine® in the United States and Canada. Titan received a non-refundable up-front license fee of $15.75 million and will receive a $50 million milestone payment upon the approval of the NDA by the FDA. Additionally, Titan will be eligible to receive up to $130 million upon achievement of specified sales milestones and up to $35 million in regulatory milestones in the event of future NDA submissions and approvals for additional indications, including chronic pain. Titan will receive tiered royalties on net sales of Probuphine ranging from the mid-teens to the low twenties.</p>
<p>Probuphine is the first product to utilize ProNeura™, a novel, proprietary, long-term drug delivery technology. The ProNeura technology has the potential to be used in developing products for the treatment of other chronic conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, where maintaining stable, round-the-clock blood levels of a drug can benefit the patient and improve medical outcomes.</p>
<p>Finally, Titan is also entitled to royalty revenue of 8-10% of net sales of Fanapt® (iloperidone), an atypical antipsychotic compound being marketed in the U.S. for the treatment of schizophrenia by Novartis Pharma AG (“Novartis”) under a sub-license agreement based on a licensed U.S. patent that expires in October 2016 (does not include a possible six month pediatric extension). Substantially all of this future royalty revenue has been sold to Deerfield Management (“Deerfield”), a healthcare investment fund, in exchange for cash and debt considerations which have been used to advance the development of Probuphine and for general corporate purposes.</p>", ,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0035/8760/358760v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0035/8760/358760v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0035/8760/358760v1-max-450x450.png, ,,

Worlds apart from the traditional translation office, tolingo translations are carried out using it’s online translation platform.  This modern method and tolingo’s worldwide translator network not only ensure high quality but also cut out bureaucracy for a much faster and more efficient service.  </p>
<p>So how does it work? The translation process at tolingo starts with the nifty little cost calculator on our homepage which allows customers to get an instant quote as well as an estimated delivery time for their text. As soon as the customer confirms the order, the digital copy of the text is sent to tolingo’s database and then picked up by an available translator with suitable language skills and specialist experience. The translator then translates the text using tolingo’s online software which simultaenously allows the customer to keep track of the order progress. After the translation is completed and once any necessary proofreading/correction is carried out, the finished order is delivered to the customer. This direct and unbureacratic chain from customer to translator to customer allows tolingo to handle a large volume of orders day and night and dramatically reduce customer waiting time.</p>
<p>With the launch of tolingo.com, tolingo hopes to reach both customers and translators on a worldwide scale. But it’s not only the customer/translator base that is unlimited; tolingo is constantly thinking up new ways to improve it’s service and technology. tolingo listens to feedback from translators and customers alike and employ a young and dynamic team to think up creative new solutions for it’s translation service and technology.

Whether they are waiting for that hot dress to go on sale, hunting for a new car across several auto sites, seeing if their dream home becomes more affordable, wanting to know when it’s time to buy or sell their stocks, keeping an eye on the job market, watching for where any new hot product is available, or keeping an eye out for the best travel deals. TrackIf puts watching the web on autopilot and keeps users aware of anything they are tracking online through a single site, which helps keep their personal information in their control and reduces the amount of spam and unwanted marketing most people receive.</p>
<p>The site features Pinterest-like capabilities – but also provides full alerting and in-depth intelligence around tracked items for a more robust experience than simply sharing pictures of items. TrackIf.com users can not only search what others are tracking based on any item’s popularity, but are powered with information about the optimal time to buy products tracked through price history tracking of 600,000 products at thousands of shopping sites, including Amazon, Wal-Mart, Target, Best Buy and others. TrackIf also features a browser plugin, which allows users to instantly track anything they see while browsing sites online such as products, saved searches, out-of-stock items, etc; and TrackIf offers mobile applications, which allows users to manage their trackers and access the product price history for any product on their mobile phone.</p>
<p>In addition to benefiting consumer users, TrackIf also provides valuable retail site integration capabilities to empower them to drive sales, including easy-to-integrate branded tools to help capture purchase intent, out-of-stock tracking, and new item alerts, which creates a highly personalized experience for site users. In addition, TrackIf automates the re-marketing of users to retail sites based on the items users are tracking, which drives higher repeat visitor rates, increases revenues, and cuts online marketing costs substantially, while also providing sites with intelligence about the future purchase interest of their online visitors.
TrackIf is planning to launch its advertising and market intelligence solutions for advertisers mid 2014, which will provide powerful resources to retailers, brands, and anyone seeking to target users based on products, sites, or to understand behavior of users online.</p>",price-comparison,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0027/5249/275249v5-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0027/5249/275249v5-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0027/5249/275249v5-max-450x450.png, ,44.9705896,-93.4554576

You get sick.  And depending on the nature of your illness, this could be anything from a nuisance to life-threatening situation.</p>
<p>No one knows this better than Marcel Muenster when, in 2009, Marcel’s dream vacation turned into this very nightmare after eating a single piece of moldy fruit in Hong Kong. Then a physician at Johns Hopkins, Muenster knew he had food poisoning, but was frustrated by his inability to access quality medical care while he was traveling in a new country. That experience led to the launch of TraveDoc, a free online doctor appointment scheduling service, accessible from any Internet-connected device, for people who need a doctor, dentist, or specialist in a new country, literally connecting doctors and patients around the globe.</p>
<p>Muenster wasn’t alone in his condition and frustration. Over 50 million people travel to less developed countries every year and 64% of these travelers have an existing health impairment.  And 16% of them seek medical care while they are abroad. Along with the language barrier, the reasons for this are easy to understand. Travelers don’t know what to do, where to go, who to see, or who to trust — whether they need to see a doctor for a chronic condition or a sudden illness.</p>
<p>This is how TraveDoc works: Patients find their physician by entering their doctor’s specialty, location, and language. Then they enter their personal information and book their appointment–including house calls–right on the doctor’s calendar. They receive a text message and/or email confirmation, including directions to their physician’s office (if applicable), and they’re on their way back to good health.  Our smart phone just keep on getting smarter and helps keep us healthier!</p>
<p>TraveDoc launched in Ghana in June 2013 and is looking to expand globally.</p>

The basis of a storyline is a set of authentic travel experiences for the selected geographic spots. Required travel services are available for arranging at the platform. A traveler manages to create such a storyline, both independently and with the help of local people or agents, who know local features. Travolver aims to be the leading online travel platform for leisure travel self-preparation and a key partner for merchants.</p>
<p>Travolver was established by online travel industry professionals in September 2011. The same year Travolver got funding from a group of angel investors. The concept of service was demonstrated at PhoCusWright’s Travel Innovation Summit 2011 (http://phocuswrightconference.com/innovators-2011) and received a positive expert feedback. In June 2012 Travolver won the “Startup Battle” organized by the Plug &amp; Play Technology Center and Global Venture Alliance (http://gvacapital.com/en/timeline/news/20/). The same month the “Travolver Awards” – an online contest for the best storyline for the independent travel was established. The contest attracted more than 10 000 likes of our target audience in social networks. A public alpha-version of the service was launched in October 2012 and Travolver iPhone app became available in December 2012. </p>
<p>At the moment there are 13 employees in the company, including 6 developers and 2 editors. 20 authors are contributing exclusively for Travolver to create a global authentic travel experience database. Contracts are signed with booking.com, Airbnb.com and online travel agency anywayanyday.com. A board of directors of the company are recognized as online industry professionals. Among them, Djasur Djumaev, Chairman of the Board (Founder and the CEO of one of the leading Russian e-commerce daily deal company KupiKupon.ru), Felix Shpilman (expert of startup market, partner in Start Fund, ex-investment professional in DST).</p>

<p>We have three programs in development: TRV027, currently in phase 2 clinical testing for the treatment of acute heart failure; TRV130, currently completing phase 1 testing for the intraveneous treatment of postoperative pain; and TRV734, currently in pre-clinical testing for oral treatment of acute and chronic pain. In addition, Trevena has built an early-stage portfolio of drug discovery programs currently in lead optimization.</p>
<p>G protein coupled receptors are the targets for more than 30% of all currently marketed therapeutics. There is significant opportunity to improve upon currently marketed GPCR drugs because many have limited efficacy and undesirable adverse effects, which can prevent broader use. Furthermore, many GPCRs are linked to diseases but cannot be translated into medicines because of specific target-related adverse effects. Trevena’s biased ligand approach has the potential to address these problems across a wide range of receptors and therapeutic areas.</p>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0004/9263/49263v1-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0004/9263/49263v1-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0004/9263/49263v1-max-450x450.jpg, ,40.100058,-75.413354

<p>Trinity-Noble has been focusing on developing and patenting solutions for the prevention of distracted driving since 2001. Our combined 75 years of experience in Business, Information Technology, and Engineering has allowed us to secure Intellectual Property rights that will allow Trinity-Noble, LLC to provide the United States and the world with novel solutions to a broadening problem on roads and rails around the globe: distracted driving due to dangerous cell phone use behind the wheel. Trinity Noble preserves human life through innovative solutions. Our mission is to leverage our technical prowess to help enforce the law and save lives on our highways and byways every day. Through unique and effective technology, our products will change and eliminate the threats of cellular device usage on our roads. 
We offer 3 highly effective platforms:</p>
<p>Guardian Angel for Mobile Platform: Downloadable cell phone application which locks a cell phone’s keypad over pre-determined speed. When paired with the vehicle via an external GPS the driver is differentiated between being the driver and a passenger. A parent or fleet administer has the ability to audit the driver’s phone remotely or configure the application to send alerts as to driver’s speed, whether or not they are trying to make a call, tampering with the GPS, etc.</p>
<p>Autolog: A cell phone detector which detects and logs cell phone use by driver and upon detecting an active call snaps a digital picture of the infraction and sends the infraction back to a central server and alerts fleet management/parent.</p>
<p>Guardian Angel for Vehicle Platform: A fully integrated, cell phone platform agnostic smart cell phone blocker which is energized by the vehicle’s power, and upon the vehicle reaching speeds above 10 MPH goes in to “listen” mode. If a cell phone signal is detected in the area of the driver’s seat an inhibiting signal is emitted by the device preventing any cell phone use until the vehicle either slows down below 10 MPH or pulls over. The call is then able to be made. Handsfree option available.</p>
<p>We have partnerships with several telematics companies as well as manufacturing consortiums that market and sell our products worldwide.</p>","safety, distracted, driving, fleet, cellphone, automobile, detection, enforcement",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0013/9381/139381v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0013/9381/139381v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0013/9381/139381v2-max-450x450.png,7,,

It’s a friend-sourced solution solving the long-standing problem of untrustworthy and irrelevant travel content. </p>
<p>Trippy launched as a finalist in the TechCrunch Disrupt SF 2011 Startup Battlefield.  The company was founded by J.R. Johnson and the team that launched and grew VirtualTourist.com and OneTime.com (both bootstrapped and grown to an annual revenue of $18MM and $8MM EBITDA) until the sites were acquired by Expedia in 2008.</p>
<p>Trippy ties into social sites like Facebook to find your friends who know about where you’re traveling to (those who have checked in, live, work, or go to school there) and who already know your personal details (like if youâ€™re vegan, have toddlers, or a penchant for pinot).  It is based on the premise that tapping into the travel experiences of your friends is far more valuable than getting questionable info from random strangers on sites that rely on crowd-sourced solutions.  </p>
<p>Along the way, Trippy aims to inspire and spread “helper joy” – that happy kick you get when a friend has a great experience thanks to advice you shared.  </p>
<p>You get helpful suggestions to make your trip great, and your friends get to relive their favorite travel moments and share their passion for places they know and love. </p>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0015/0579/150579v2-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0015/0579/150579v2-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0015/0579/150579v2-max-450x450.jpg, ,,

<p>TRIXandTRAX is a game designed to give recognition to anyone who can perform action that thrills you or anyone who can create music that inspires you. Its gaming platform spans live recreational activities that are recorded and uploaded, virtual communities that connect through social gaming, and live events that become part of a TV franchise format. TRIXandTRAX is set to become a world-class media property powered by the social web.
The game brings together users from two categories: TRIX and TRAX.  A â€œTRIXâ€ is anyone who can execute visually stunning actions, for example, on a skateboard, a bike or a snowboard. A â€œTRAXâ€ is anyone who creates music that inspires people, for example, mixing beats DJ-style, jamming on a guitar, or freestyle rapping. Performers upload videos or tracks to show off their talents and build up virtual communities. Everyone can follow live events and interact with top performers in each market through a TV format that attracts and rewards audience participation.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND AND AWARDS</p>
<p>TRIXandTRAX was originally conceived by VEN A KITE, an international production company.  Since 2003, VEN A KITE has been redefining branded entertainment with compelling content that integrates online communities, live events and TV reality shows, working with global clients such as Nokia, Samsung and LG.
Since its inception, TRIXandTRAX has been warmly received by industry experts, obtaining consecutive nominations at MIPTVâ€™s Content 360 Digital Creativity Festival in 2010 and 2011. At this, the largest annual meeting of </p>
<p>the content market held in Cannes, France, TRIXandTRAX was selected as a finalist in the categories â€œNext Generation Audience Engagementâ€ and â€œInteractive and Cross Media Digital Entertainment Formatsâ€, as judged by executives from some of the most important players in the entertainment industry. </p>
<p>BUSINESS STRATEGY</p>
<p>The strategy of the company is to grow revenue by working with sponsor brands and reaching out to local communities with offerings that will attract early users and facilitate game discovery. Once discovered, the gameâ€™s scalable social platform engages wider audiences via a freemium model. In each market, these audiences can then be further monetized through live events that become part of a TV franchise format. This in turn leads to higher levels of exposure with positive spillover benefits for the TRIXandTRAX media property, compounding its value and making it capable of generating annual revenue in excess of $1 billion. 
To execute its strategy to build TRIXandTRAX into a valuable media property such as American Idol, Spiderman or Heroes, the company is putting in place partnerships with local communities, game developers and production companies. As part of its selection as a finalist in the MIPTV contest, the company is currently under agreement with Fremantle Media, an industry leader, for the future co-development of the TV format for TRIXandTRAX. The companyâ€™s focus is now on securing sources of funding to beef up its efforts to work with local communities and with game developers.</p>
<p>Supporting TRIXandTRAX goes beyond helping to build a valuable media property; it entails supporting a cause that inspires people to create a better world. TRIXandTRAX:
1)  Empowers people to express their creativity through music and action sports
2)  Connects people with others who follow their passion, and creates role models for newer generations
3)  Creates a standard, equal-access platform that recognizes talent in non-traditional but high growth recreational activities
4)  Provides a unique channel for sponsor brands to get to know and support local talent
5)  Encourages healthier habits that come as a result of active lifestyles and musical training</p>","content, gaming, tv, social-media",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0013/4018/134018v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0013/4018/134018v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0013/4018/134018v2-max-450x450.png,3,,

This leads to bad care and burdens on loved ones. Moreover, the mean inpatient charge for patients without directives was more than three times higher than for those who had directives, and patient and family satisfaction increased when documents were accessible.</p>
<p>TrueNorth focuses on the the most important part of planning - picking your Advocate, the person who will make important healthcare decisions for you if your are not able to (also known as a Healthcare Proxy, Agent or Durable Power of Attorney). On one side of the platform, users can easily create and electronically sign this important form - no more papers that get lost or tampered with. Users can then share this information with loved ones electronically via email or create special care networks through our Facebook app. On the other side of the TrueNorth platform, this critical information is made accessible through integration with electronic medical record platforms so that it can be made available where and when it’s needed - in the hospital, in the emergency room, in your doctors’ hands.</p>
<p>Who we are sets us apart. Our team draws on real-life experience and we are part of a community of care providers and patient advocates that understand the problem and can build a sustainable solution.

Tuenti Móvil is the first Telco 2.0 offering in-the-cloud telephone services. Focused on client experience, centered on data, and totally online, Tuenti incorporates unique, innovative features in its app such as account management, customer service, and free use of the app even without phone credit. </p>
<p>Founded in 2006, Tuenti is the most successful tech company in the history of the Internet in Spain. It has put the mobile at the center of its strategy and is committed to talent, innovation and strong value-added services for its clients and users. Approximately 200 professionals from different countries make up the team. It’s main shareholder is Telefónica, an international telecommunications group, who became strategic investor in 2010. </p>
<p>Tuenti, pronounced in Spanish, sounds like Twenty in English. The name, however, actually comes from “tu enti[dad],” meaning “your entity.” Tuenti is mainly targeted at the Spanish audience.</p>
<p>Zaryn Dentzel, CEO, and Kenny Bentley, the lead programmer, came to Spain after having worked in social networking in the United States. Kenny Bentley is credited with coding most of the original platform from a small office in the north of Madrid in Spring 2006, while Zaryn Dentzel led the project and was involved in much of the design and strategy.</p>
<p>Tuenti whose social networking website was referred to as the “Spanish Facebook” featured many tools common to social-networking sites. It allowed users to set up a profile, upload photos, link videos and connect with friends. Many other utilities, such as the ability to create events, were also offered. Unlike similar social networking sites which feature banner advertisements, Tuenti opted out of those traditional forms of “noisy” and obstructive advertising.</p>
<p>According to the Google Annual Search Report, “tuenti” was the fourth fastest-rising global search term in 2008, and Alexa Internet ranks the site as one of the top-ten most visited in Spain. </p>

<p>Founded in 2007 by avid music lover and industry leader, Gabriel Adiv, TuneUp was born out of personal frustration with the shortcomings of his own digital music library. He had too many songs titled “Track 01”, no cover art, and no easy means of accessing additional album, artist or concert information. Everything he loved about his vinyl and CD collection was lost in translation, as the digital music industry scrambled to catch up.</p>
<p>TuneUp Media develops products to not only address these issues, but also tap the broader digital and social media universe to create an experience far beyond anything Gabe could have found in his liner notes. Now, millions of digital music consumers around the world have used TuneUp to clean up and organize their music metadata, intelligently find and remove duplicate songs, fill in missing album cover art, explore their world of music and share it with friends.</p>
<p>Best of all, TuneUp works “automagically”. Behind it’s simple interface lies cutting-edge acoustic fingerprinting technology, backed by the Gracenote’s MusicID, the world’s largest database of music-related metadata, boasting over 90 million indexed tracks.</p>","itunes, software, music-management, music-discovery, acoustic-fingerprinting, waveform-recognition, music-tech, mucic-technology",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0001/8408/18408v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0001/8408/18408v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0001/8408/18408v1-max-450x450.png, ,37.7654195,-122.4119381

The vast majority of current media based technologies target a limited number of metals and operate under strict conditions. Other separation technologies need complex systems to operate and are sensitive to various contaminants regularly found in these waters.</p>
<p>The Tusaar technology involves the surface treatment and impregnation of granulated activated carbon with environmentally friendly organic compounds. It works in an acidic environment, targets over 40 different metals, requires minimal pre-treatment and is simple to use. In most applications the metals sequestered can be recovered if necessary although preliminary testing shows that metal saturated media also passes EPA mandated TCLP tests.</p>
<p>The technology has one issued patent and two pending. It will find application in treating industrial waste and process streams, recovering/recycling rare earth &amp; precious metals and the sequestering of actinides.</p>
<p>The technology offers significant advantages in its ease of application, cost and wide applicability.</p>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0041/2957/412957v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0041/2957/412957v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0041/2957/412957v1-max-450x450.png, ,,

<p>Broadcasters on TVU include CNN, Turner Broadcasting, Cartoon Network, FamilyNet, Telemundo, Deutsche Welle, Globo, and TV9 India.  </p>
<p>At the core of the TVU platform is their patent-pending Real-time Packet Replication (RPR) technology.  RPR allows broadcasters to achieve massively higher reach and significantly lower broadcast costs over traditional streaming and CDN technologies.  RPR enables the delivery of a live TV signal, of up to HD quality, to millions of TV viewers around the globe using a single TVUBroadcast appliance and a single ADSL connection. With RPR, all the viewers watching a channel cooperate and contribute bandwidth to give everyone the best possible signal and viewing experience.  The bandwidth required to broadcast therefore does not increase with the number of viewers and higher viewership actually enhances the viewing quality. </p>
<p>With TVU, broadcasters are offered a full suite of monetization tools, including subscription channels, pay-per-view events, and personalized in-stream ad insertion tools.  Content rights management tools and geo-filtering capabilities allow broadcasters to limit their coverage to specific regions, allowing them for example to honor existing cable distribution contracts while expanding their reach.  </p>

Because so many people tweet about what they’re watching on TV, this guide is an incredibly accurate portrayal of what people are watching at any given moment. And, you can use the guide to find what to watch, and what channel number to find it on, without having to hit the guide button on your TV remote.</p>

When you click on any program on our guide, you’ll enter a “tweet room” where we have continuously curate and sort tweets just for that program. You can engage and interact with others watching the same program by replying to their tweets, creating private tweet conversations with friends, and even using our live video chat feature to see people as you tweet and read tweets about whatever you’re watching. Meanwhile, our social TV guide is constantly moving in the background, ready for you to jump in to the next conversation and keeping you up to date on where the action is on your TV.</p>","social-tv, twitter, tv",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0016/5265/165265v2-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0016/5265/165265v2-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0016/5265/165265v2-max-450x450.jpg,2,,

<p>Typemock develops next generation .NET and C++ unit testing tools. Typemock’s tools enable developers of all levels to unit test easier, become more Agile, and easily improve their code. The Typemock tools have been downloaded by many of developers worldwide, and are in use in thousands of companies, such as Texas Instruments, Saab and Corillian. </p>
<p>Enterprises spend a lot of time and money in the QA-developer testing cycle. The QA find bugs, send them back to the developer to be fixed, and the cycle repeats. (According to IEEE) Defects that are corrected during development are 90% cheaper than finding them in the QA stage. With our innovative tools, creating unit tests during development by the development team is simpler and TDD (test driven development) adoption within your enterprise will increase. This enables developers to run automatic tests, deliver higher quality code that is easier to adapt and maintain. </p>
<p>Typemock’s unique tools have been proven to save time and money by shortening the software development cycle, and significantly reducing the time to market and the development costs. Many of our customers have shown to save $80,000 per seat per year!</p>
<p>Our products, are simple, easy to use and integrate directly into Microsoft’s Visual Studio 2005, 2008 and Team System.</p>
<p>Isolator enables any developer of C# or VB.NET, to start unit testing their code immediately no matter what kind of platform, such as SharePoint, ASP.NET, databases, web services or home grown- using a simple concept to divide and conquer by isolating dependencies.</p>
<p>Isolator for SharePoint helps developers working on Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007-based applications unit test, and is the only way they can unit test their code without installing a SharePoint server. Isolator for SharePoint has the power and ease-of-use that had become Typemock’s trademark, but is designed specifically for SharePoint developers.</p>
<p>Racer enables developers that develop parallel code to visualize and pinpoint complex parallel issues such as deadlocks and race conditions.</p>

<p>Game officials have a difficult job, and they should be fully prepared for success each time they step on the field or court.  A uniform, standardized approach to the training and development of officials needs to be created.  Better officiating leads to better sports, which leads to a better experience for all, especially our youth.  Developing this life skill not only creates better officials, but it enables a more confident, assertive and communicative official.</p>
<p>The Tyros is a multi-facetted web application consisting of an online community and social messaging system. It also contains a training and development tool.  All of these tools are specific to sports officials.</p>

<p>The MonkeyBusinessâ„¢ Network adds a missing element to typical e-commerce; it integrates the social aspect of business that exists in brick-and-mortar shopping. One thing that MonkeyBusinessâ„¢ leverages is the value of knowing companies more intimately. This major obstacle for online commerce has existed for years. Consumers feel that online salesmen act like robots, emotionless interfaces of information with only one goal: to complete trade transactions. This may work fine for certain types of mass-produced or reliable products or automated services, but it does not account for a vast majority of products, services, events, media and other commodities where the seller really must add a personal sense of value-added that must be conveyed in order to finalize a transaction and deliver a service.</p>
<p>This particular problem of conveying seller pathos (an emotional connection from buyer to seller) can hardly be established with just a numerical seller reputation score, and not just a online retail environment. But online pathos can be established easily, such as in social networks and dating websites, chatrooms, discussion-boards in any online community. Is seller pathos important for business? Absolutely, if you happen to be like the vast majority of the world who makes a living selling or making something other than mass-produced products and or automated information services.</p>
<p>The MonkeyBusinessâ„¢ Network is not just an auctionhouse or a huge product catalog; it is its own trading ecosystem. Imagine a shopping mall where you don’t have to spend any money to spend time at, and are not pressured to ask questions to merchants regarding only specific products. A shopping mall where you can set up a storefront for your own products and services without any monetary investment to the mall itself. A shopping mall where you don’t even have to buy anything or sell anything in order to belong or have meaningful relationships or discussions. A shopping mall where you can be yourself in, and have friends that aren’t just you’re friends because of what’s in your wallet. Belonging to the network is more than buying, selling, producing, and marketing. Life is more than those things, so why shouldn’t shopping be more than those things, when the purpose of shopping is generally to improve one’s life?</p>
<p>This type of shopping mall is the future of e-commerce; a social network marketplace. Not just a marketplace; not just a social network. It’s the synergistic combination of both environments together that propels its effectiveness. And once you add the ability to earn money by promoting other peoples products, it becomes a social marketplace where everyone can be involved on a profitable level– and the distinctions between social class dissolve, since any seller can buy, any buyer can sell, anyone can trade, and anyone can sell anything that sellers want help selling. So many opportunities are available on this type of network that you don’t have to sell things just to make money; you can choose only products you believe in, and support only sellers that you appreciate. In a social network marketplace, nobody necessarily thinks of you as one type of actor and nobody is confined to just one role, because everyone can play all of the roles, and is encouraged to do so. Isn’t this more a model of how all trade really works, and how the economy regulates itself? Or is this just a new age fantasy? U4EA Networks, Inc. thinks this not a fantasy; it is the best model for an online marketplace that ever existed, and so today they are turning this model into an online reality. </p>","e-commerce, social-networking, trade-network",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0013/6767/136767v2-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0013/6767/136767v2-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0013/6767/136767v2-max-450x450.jpg,3,,

<p>Users join the community by signing up with Facebook or Twitter and can also connect their Last.fm account.</p>
<p>Users create real world “hangouts” showing where they are going to be and when and broadcast these directly from the app through Facebook and Twitter to invite whoever is free to “come join”. Anyone who joins can also invite their friends by broadcasting the hangout through their own networks.</p>
<p>Adding tags to hangouts matches these to local uberlife users’ interests too, as well as their Facebook Likes and Last.fm bands, to notify them that a hangout is taking place that they’re interested in and to invite them to join.</p>
<p>Users can check in to hangouts, post comments and upload photos creating a digital memory capture of the hangout and group photo display. These actions are also (soon to be) broadcast-able directly from the app through Facebook and Twitter that enables a live activity stream before, during and after the hangout.</p>
<p>Users can follow other uberlife users that they’d like to hang out with to be notified when that person creates a nearby hangout. Users only become Friends in uberlife IF they are following each other AND they have attended the same hangout i.e. hung out in real life.  </p>
<p>All users earn a Connector Score when they create hangouts and connect people in real life. When two people join a hangout and then follow each other in uberlife, the “creator” boosts their Connector Score by one. </p>","local, mobile, social, iphone, app, location, location-based, social-network, socialising, real-world",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0017/6348/176348v2-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0017/6348/176348v2-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0017/6348/176348v2-max-450x450.jpg,8,,

<p>According to Evelyn Rusli of TechCrunch, here’s how Unsocial works: “A user signs up via his or her LinkedIn account and Unsocial uses that profile to collect basic information on the personâ€™s career. The user inputs ‘smart tags,’ or rather keywords, that describe his/her professional background (for example you might include ‘journalist,’ ‘writer,’ or ‘technology’) and the traits of people s/he is seeking.</p>
<p>When youâ€™re ready to use the application, you simply open it up and click on the first button, ‘People,’ which will show you relevant, nearby matches, if you find someone you want to connect with you can send a direct message through the platform (or e-mail/call them if that information is available). The service is ideal for large conferences or similar events where attendees have a limited amount of time to identify high-value contacts.”</p>","social-network, people-you-need-to-know, foursquare-meets-linkedin",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0010/6070/106070v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0010/6070/106070v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0010/6070/106070v1-max-450x450.png, ,,

<p>History of uShip:<br/>
In many ways, uShip.com was born in the back of a rented moving van. As CEO and Founder Matt Chasen was moving from Seattle to Texas, his mother had been struggling to move a dresser from Ohio to Texas. When Matt arrived to pick up the 9-foot van he ordered, it was sold out, leaving him with a 20-foot truck. As he drove the virtually empty truck to Texas, he wondered if there may be someone in a similar situation in Ohio with enough room to bring home his mother’s dresser. Matt continued to tinker with the idea over the coming year, and when he arrived at the University of Texas, he eventually joined with fellow business school students Jay Manickam and Mickey Millsap. The three further developed the business plan to take advantage of all these empty trucks to make shipping more affordable. </p>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0000/2035/2035v3-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0000/2035/2035v3-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0000/2035/2035v3-max-450x450.jpg,183,,

SMEs contribute around two thirds of national income and provide the foundation for a stable middle class in many African countries. They help form strong communities and are a powerful force for poverty reduction. SMEs play a significant role in building economic stability and sustainability for the future. As Africa enters the new millennium it faces a challenge to provide better economic opportunities for citizens through sustained growth and alleviating the poverty that has long plagued the continent. The NEPAD (New Economic Platform for African Development) and the United Nations Millennium Goals for 2015, to which the EU-countries have all subscribed, have set out ambitious aims in this respect. The World Economic Forum in Davos and the G8 have also made the commitment to stimulate private and public investments in Africa. However, it’s our belief that the most meaningful impact will still come from grassroots entrepreneurship and local efforts. It is important to support this bottom-up approach of citizens working to tackle local challenges and build on the idea that any person anywhere in the world might have the skills, knowledge and resources needed to make a difference.</p>
<p>The Vision</p>
<p>Millions of entrepreneurs building innovative companies across the continent that serve to redefine Africa and lead it into the 21st century. To lead the charge in establishing the continent as a dynamic and creative hotbed for innovation and social development tapping into limitless potential.</p>
<p>The Objective</p>
<p>VC4Africa aims to connect innovative entrepreneurs (and their ideas) with access to knowledge, markets and capital i.e. mentors, business partners and investors. The focus is on entrepreneurs with innovative projects that apply new technology, new media, the web, mobile and green energy. Extra emphasis is placed on social entrepreneurs, otherwise individuals that make use of these tools in ways that betters the environment and society while making a profit.</p>
<p>How are we doing this?</p>
<p>Leveraging the power of new media technologies, VC4Africa aims to lower existing barriers to entry i.e. lack of information, viable networks and capital to name a few. The VC4Africa platform is free for anyone to join and the entire network (and its content) is open and accessible to anyone (registered or not*). At the same time, any member is able to contribute to VC4Africas own development. A core vision behind the project is that VC4Africa is only a platform within a larger social movement. Open communication and collaboration is encouraged and all members are invited to become active participants in both growing and developing the VC4Africa community. This means members are encouraged to invite new members, post content, start discussions, initiate networking events and join the VC4Africa management team in a more concerted effort to grow, develop and evolve the concept.</p>
<p>*Anyone can access VC4Africa content. The system and network is open to anyone who is interested. That said, direct participation or engagement with the network requires registration and an obligation to abide by the community established rules. See our Disclaimer &amp; Terms of Service.</p>
<p>Building a viable community of entrepreneurs and investors it is important to let members engage the VC4Africa community (+/- 7000 members) via the social networking platforms that feel most comfortable and are the most useful to them. Currently the community can be found on social networking platforms like Linkedin (+/- 4500 members), Ning (+/- 2000 members), Facebook (+/- 200 members) and Twitter (+/- 3700 members). Members of the VC4Africa community use these social platforms to connect with other members and to exchange knowledge, information and contacts.</p>
<p>Member initiated networking events:</p>
<p>Second to networking online, VC4Africa makes use of the Barcamp model for events and organizes its own VC4Africa Meetups, otherwise informal networking events initiated by any member in the network interested in bringing together members in their own area. Events have already been hosted in Johannesburg, Kampala, Nairobi, Abuja, San Francisco, New York, Washington D.C. and London. The power of these events is that any member can set up their own event giving them a sense of ownership. It brings in new members and makes the network accessible locally. It also establishes future points of contact. Want to initiate your very own VC4Africa Meetup?</p>
<p>We engage members:</p>
<p>The VC4Africa community also initiated an as Officers Programe used to engage active members in running and building the network. Officers take on different tasks in managing the community and are responsible for specific functions i.e. someone that manages the blog, someone that invites new members on Linked in or responsible for growing the network on Facebook. These individuals are instrumental to the vitality of the project and help spread the word virally through their own networks. Moreover, they bring in new ideas and make valuable contributions that help define the scope and focus of the project. Interested in joining the VC4Africa Officers Program?</p>
<p>Given the current structure members are well empowered to interact, find and share information within a network dedicated to building innovative businesses in Africa.</p>

This innovative product supported fast file-level recovery and VM migration inside VMware environments. Future focus was on the development and marketing for Veeam Backup &amp; Replication. In 2010, Veeam Backup &amp; Replication won the Best of Show and New Technology awards in VMworld. Veeam’s flagship product grew so quickly, it was used by more than 20,000 customers worldwide in 2011. Once Veeam Backup &amp; Replication v6 was released, Veeam expanded its business to Microsoft Hyper-V users. As Veeam continued to grow, so did the awards, such as in 2012 where Veeam Backup &amp; Replication won VMworld’s Best Virtualization and Server Consolidation, Best of Show and Best Virtualization for Disaster Recovery awards. Veeam Backup &amp; Replication v7 was released in August 2013 and is used by more than 73,000 customers worldwide.</p>","vmware-backup, hyper-v-backup, vsphere-replication, vmware-backup-solutions, vmware-replication, vm-backup, esxi-backup, vmware-backup-software, hyper-v-replication, backup-vmware, virtual-machine-backup, backup-hyper-v, free-vmware-backup, backup-esxi, v",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0003/1478/31478v2-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0003/1478/31478v2-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0003/1478/31478v2-max-450x450.jpg,1500,40.088052,-83.088566
