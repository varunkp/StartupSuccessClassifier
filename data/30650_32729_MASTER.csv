Users can upload, print, and share photos with friends. Printing photos is Snapfishâ€™s main focus for the site. This is a different focus than most photo sharing and storage sites that usually have a strong focus on the community aspect, like Flickr.</p>
<p>Snapfish has even partnered with retail stores like Costco and Walgreens so you can pick up your prints locally. Users can also easily create gifts, photo books and cards using their photos.</p>
<p>Users are encouraged to upload as many photos as they want since they have unlimited uploads. However, to keep unlimited upload status users are required to buy prints at least once every year or their photos will be deleted. This is easy to get around since you can buy a single print for around $0.12.</p>

<p>Fanning, Mendelson and Conway founded SNOCAP in the days immediately following Napsterâ€™s demise. Many of the companyâ€™s employees, including its COO, <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/person/ali-aydar"" title=""Ali Aydar"">Ali Aydar</a>, were veterans of the original Napster team.</p>
<p>SNOCAPâ€™s initial focus was on developing technology content owners (in particular artists and labels) could use to register their content and set business rules controlling where and how that content is available on the web. SNOCAP eventually secured deals with all four major labels (Universal Music Group, EMI, Warner Music Group, and SonyBMG Music Entertainment) to register their content in SNOCAPâ€™s digital registry. </p>
<p>SNOCAPâ€™s ultimate goal was to license this technology to file-sharing services, enabling a new wave of â€œlegal P2Pâ€ù services that used SNOCAPâ€™s technology to track and filter music sharing within a network, blocking registered content that labels &amp; artists didnâ€™t want shared but allowing sharing of anything else. While two file-sharing services, Mashboxx and Grokster, signed up to use SNOCAPâ€™s technology, their SNOCAP-powered services never launched.</p>
<p>In late 2006, SNOCAP and <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/myspace"" title=""MySpace"">MySpace</a> announced that they were partnering to give independent artists and labels a way to sell music on MySpace through SNOCAPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s MyStore widgets. Eventually, over 110,000 artists signed up to sell their music through MyStore widgets. These early experiments were a precursor to MySpaceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s efforts to sell downloads directly to consumers through its <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/myspace-music"" title=""MySpace Music"">MySpace Music</a> venture. </p>
<p>In March 2007, SNOCAP announced it was partnering with the social media site <a href=""http://crunchbase.com/company/imeem"" title=""imeem"">imeem</a> to track music being played on the site and share ad revenue with artists and labels, utilizing SNOCAPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s content fingerprinting and digital registry technology. The goal was to provide a way for consumers to upload and share music with their friends, for free, and to do so in a way where label and artists can both make money and have greater control over where and how their music was available. imeem rolled out this new offering in June 2007.</p>
<p>In April 2008, imeem acquired SNOCAP, confirming rumors first reported on TechCrunch two months earlier. That acquisition reunited several members of the original Napster team, including SNOCAPâ€™s then COO, Ali Aydar, who is now imeemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s COO. Aydar was a key early advisor to imeem and served on its board of directors from 2003-2007.</p>
<p>imeem continues to operate the SNOCAP digital registry, and uses the technology acquired from SNOCAP to power imeemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ad-supported streaming music service.</p>
<p>SNOCAP was backed by Ron Conway, Morgenthaler Ventures, WaldenVC, and Court Square Ventures. In total, the company raised over $25 million in funding from WaldenVC, Morgenthaler Ventures, and Court Square Ventures.</p></body></html>","musicdistribution, p2p, imeem, al-aydar, shawn-fanning, napster, myspace, myspace-music, fingerprinting, content-management, dalton-caldwell",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0000/4297/4297v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0000/4297/4297v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0000/4297/4297v1-max-450x450.png, ,,47,/company/snoobe,Snoobe,http://www.snoobe.com,mobile,"390,000",operating,USA,,United States - Other,,2,2/1/12, 2012-02 ,2012-Q1,2012,2/10/13,10/25/13,6/1/13,"<html><body><p>Snoobe is a patent-pending platform that combines the practicality of a smartphone app with the strength of a powerful comparison, recommendation and lead management engine.

<li><p>Trading Indicator API
Multiple studies over the past years have shown that Twitter sentiment can be used as an indicator for future stock price movement.

The stock price predictions are based upon various machine learning algorithms and have an accuracy as high as 60 percent with an average of 54 percent. The predictions take away extra noise in asset pricing, and can be used by investors as an additional trading indicator on top of fundamental analysis and technical analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Financial Sentiment API
Sentiment is hard to classify in financially themed Twitter messages, mainly because financial markets speak their own language of fear and greed. The Financial Sentiment API is specifically trained to deal with unstructured context and financial jargon, and has an accuracy of 84.3% on a binary scale and an accuracy of 76.8% on a three point scale. </p></li>

Classify sentiment in social media messages surrounding brands. The algorithm is specifically tailored to brands, products &amp; company information. It has an accuracy of 84.7% on a binary scale and an accuracy of 86.9% on a three point scale. </p></li>

Social Bicycles designs bike share bicycles, equipment and software. The company offers all of their customers (municipal, institutional, and commercial markets) bike share operations training and technical support. </p>
<p>SoBi pioneered an innovative â€œsmart bikeâ€ù approach using an integrated GPS-enabled lock that works with affordable bike racks. This new paradigm is shifting the bike sharing equipment industry, providing more flexible fleet management for operators and richer features for bike share program members while reducing overall operating costs.</p>
<p>The company was founded by Ryan Rzepecki in New York City. As an urban planner and project manager for the New York City Department of Transportationâ€™s bike program, Ryan watched as bike share systems began spread around the globe. He loved the concept but felt that infrastructure costs needed to be reduced in order for bike share to be financially sustainable. He identified one of the core problems, expensive smart-dock infrastructure, and set out to change the industry by using mobile technology to deliver a more affordable and advanced alternative.</p>
<p>SoBi technology continues to improve with advanced features from the tech industry to provide software and hardware that achieves cost reductions and efficiency gains. These unique features have fueled the companyâ€™s explosive growth and changed the landscape of the bike share industry.</p></body></html>","bikeshare, bike-share, bike-sharing, transportation, last-mile, m2m, iot, social, bicycles, alternate-transportation",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0010/9487/109487v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0010/9487/109487v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0010/9487/109487v2-max-450x450.png,11,,87,/company/social-collective,Social Collective,http://thesocialcollective.com,social,"20,000",closed,USA,VA,Washington DC,Arlington,1,4/17/09, 2009-04 ,2009-Q2,2009,4/18/09,4/18/09,11/16/09,"<html><body><p>The Social Collective provides a hosted service that gives conference organizers their own mini-<a href=""/company/facebook"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Facebook"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""/company/twitter"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Twitter"">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>Why SocialDiabetes? So far, diabetes has been considered as something personal and nontransferable. We think itâ€™s time for a change. How? Taking advantage of the knowledge that we, diabetic patients, have on our own disease and sharing it through this application.</p>
<p>The application has the aim of improving your autonomy, flexibility and risk control, providing you with an aid in the self-management of both food intake and insulin dose administration.</p>
<p>Taking into account the insulin guidelines prescribed by your doctor, you can introduce several variables into the system that will alter the optimum dose you need to inject yourself. Thus you will gain freedom and self-confidence in daily life, in every issue related to the disease. The system is also capable of avoiding hypoglycaemias during the night, the most dangerous for a diabetic person, by recommending you to have a snack before going to bed if this is the case, and letting you know the exact equivalence in carbohydrates of the intake. This is achieved through an intelligent system implemented within the application suited to learn your reaction to food intake and to the administered insulin dose.</p>
<p>SocialDiabetes allow your doctor manage the control of your diabetes remotely thanks to statistics, evolutive analysis, alert management and messages between the management web and your mobile device. There are outstanding advantages: saving time and money, and avoiding inconveniences in your daily life.</p></body></html>","diabetes, social, mobile, health, blood, glucometer",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0020/6160/206160v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0020/6160/206160v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0020/6160/206160v2-max-450x450.png,4,,134,/company/socialdial,SocialDial,http://socialdial.com,messaging,"1,000,000",closed,USA,CA,SF Bay,Pleasanton,1,1/1/12, 2012-01 ,2012-Q1,2012,4/1/12,4/1/12,,"<html><body><p>Socialdial, Inc. is a next generation communications company that produces several products for mobile and web platforms.</p></body></html>",conference-call-public-spealomg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0020/8339/208339v2-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0020/8339/208339v2-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0020/8339/208339v2-max-450x450.jpg,5,,135,/company/socialears,SocialEars,http://www.socialears.com,enterprise,"200,000",operating,USA,CA,SF Bay,Aptos,1,2/7/12, 2012-02 ,2012-Q1,2012,8/23/12,8/23/12,2/7/12,"<html><body><p>SocialEars is a radically different approach to social listening software.

As a P2P lender, SocietyOne connects savvy investors and creditworthy borrowers in a way that is cheaper, faster and more efficient.</p>
<p>SocietyOne enables individuals to lend and borrow money to each other without the intermediation of a bank or financial institution. Qualified borrowers can request up to $30,000 in unsecured personal loans at competitive rates determined by their credit history. Approved applications are listed on the platform for verified investors to assess and bid on. Once terms are agreed and accepted by the parties, SocietyOne handles the funds management and servicing of every loan on behalf of the matched borrowers and investors. Stringent procedures and processes ensure a safe and secure lending environment.</p>
<p>Our philosophy is to exploit the structural mispricing and operating inefficiencies that exist in the traditional banking sector to bring borrowers and investors better rates. We are unencumbered by the branch infrastructure, overhead and capital reserve requirements that drive up operating costs for traditional banks and believe our proprietary ClearMatch technology platform allows us to radically reduce the cost of originating, servicing, and funding of traditional loans.  </p>
<p>This means that we are able to pass the savings on to investors and borrowers alike by sharing our lower operating cost advantage.  Qualifying borrowers with good credit history and strong capacity to repay get access to cheaper loans while investors have the opportunity to lock in more attractive rates of return. â€¨â€¨</p>

<p>Innovators like the World Bank, Medicare, Data.gov, EnergyStar, New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Oregon and Maryland, have all chosen Socrata for its turnkey and low-cost cloud delivery of easy-to-use open data products.</p>
<p>Socrataâ€™s toolkit goes well beyond creating data catalogues. The companyâ€™s products are designed to support a lively ecosystem around open data.</p>
<p>For example, every data set on Socrata is API-enabled with accompanying documentation, allowing developers and entrepreneurs to query data sets easily to create apps. Meanwhile, citizens, researchers, and journalists can search for the information they want without filling out a F.O.I.A. request or digging through papers. They can easily create digital visualizations, such as map mashups, charts, and graphs, with data. These same citizens then embed their creations on another website, where the data included will refresh automatically. And, they can give feedback to the agency hosting the data about their experience, creating a full feedback loop between citizens and government.</p>
<p>In addition, Socrata GovStat combines openly accessible government data and a drag-and-drop report-creation tool, Socrata DataSlate, to offer an efficient way for government agencies to track their progress against goals and engage with the public about the results. Designed by former Director of Maryland StateStat, Beth Blauer, GovStat is transforming the cost and effectiveness of government performance management.</p></body></html>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0007/0719/70719v7-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0007/0719/70719v7-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0007/0719/70719v7-max-450x450.png, ,,196,/company/socrates-health-solutions,Socrates Health Solutions,http://socrateshealthsolutions.com,hardware,"1,285,000",operating,USA,TX,Dallas,Dallas,1,,,,,12/12/13,12/12/13,,"<html><body><p>Socrates Health Solutions is headquarted in Dallas, Texas and is a Delaware based corporation.

<p>Sodraft is a Vancouver based technology startup which aims to enter the dynamic fantasy Sports Market through the development of a social drafting simulator. This simulator has transformed the traditional serpentine draft into a robust online platform which empowers its users to draft a single team and directly compete with an unlimited number of competitors; all without compromising the integrity of the draft or user experience. Essentially, this is the first and only platform which has successfully re-imagined the traditional draft into a truly social platform. With 1 in 9 Americans participating in fantasy sports leagues, and significant growth for fantasy sports around the globe, Sodraft aims to become the primary social platform for Fantasy Sports world-wide. </p>
<p>The X-Draft simulator (US Provisional Patent) combines a traditional serpentine draft with a tiered-path picking system, producing over 16 trillion unique team combinations. Membership and participation with Sodraft is completely free, and all users will be automatically enrolled to compete in the main fantasy league for each sport in which they draft a team. These users will then be eligible for a variety of weekly and seasonal cash prizes. In addition to the â€œHouse Leagueâ€ù, a â€œGroupsâ€ù function will allow users to create their own private leagues, or join public leagues for Colleges, Cities, States and Countries. This will increase their prize contention, while also giving users the ability to socially compete against as many or as few users as they like. With very few innovations to seasonal fantasy sports games since its online inception, industry leaders have been scrambling to develop new ways to retain existing users and attract new comers. Sodraft is confident the X-Draft is the innovation the fantasy sports industry needs to re-engage the veterans and entice potential new players.    </p>
<p>Sodraft has has developed a fully functional beta version, and will run an Indiegogo campaign to try and raise funds to cover hosting and licensing fees for to launch for the 2013 NFL season. </p></body></html>","fantasy-sports, sports, social-networking",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0028/9314/289314v2-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0028/9314/289314v2-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0028/9314/289314v2-max-450x450.jpg,7,49.2755037,-123.124831207,/company/soevolved,Soevolved,http://soevolved.com,social,"500,000",operating,,,unknown,,1,1/1/11, 2011-01 ,2011-Q1,2011,7/30/12,7/30/12,,"<html><body><p>icangowithout exists to empower and assist this force, by providing tools to create sustainable positive impacts on local and international levels. </p></body></html>","mobile, ventures, good, charity",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0036/6638/366638v1-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0036/6638/366638v1-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0036/6638/366638v1-max-450x450.jpg,10, , 208,/company/sofa-labs,Sofa Labs,http://thread.com,social,"1,200,000",operating,USA,CA,SF Bay,San Mateo,2,1/1/09, 2009-01 ,2009-Q1,2009,5/1/09,9/1/09,9/1/09,"<html><body><p>Sofa Labs is a developer of social applications.

<p>If you qualify, Solmentum installs solar panels on your roof. Because of recent energy programs at both the State and the Federal level, this process requires only a minimal upgrade fee.

<p>Since its inception, Solmentum has provided this peace of mind to more than 1,000 happy homeowners in the form of over 5MW of electricity.

<p>SoMoLend is the first of its kind in many ways as a fully transparent portal that allows investors to look into the eyes of business borrowers in their own neighborhood before making any lending decisions. With SoMo, individuals, banks, local governments, business associations, chambers of commerce and municipalities can invest in small businesses by use of a safe, secure, easy-to-use platform. SoMo is designed with the capability of allowing and promoting peer-to-peer lending, by which business borrowers can get loans from friends and family, customers, Twitter followers, Facebook friends and LinkedIn connections. SoMo will launch peer-to-peer lending nationwide in 2013.</p>
<p>In 2010 the founder of SoMoLend, Candace Klein, began a micro-lending program matched with a womenâ€™s only, training-based program for participants to earn funding for their start-up companies. There were start-ups that were not able to attain funding through this specific program, and it became apparent that small businesses everywhere needed an advocate. The idea for SoMoLend came from this realization and the desire to assist start-ups that were not able to gain funding through the program.</p>
<p>SoMoLend was founded in 2011 to serve small businesses that are not being served by traditional funding. SoMoLend was created on the principal of communities and people helping each other out: people investing in people. We strive as a company to assist local businesses, help entrepreneurs to grow, and allow lenders to invest in the companies and ideas they believe in most. Small businesses create jobs and support local communities, but are struggling to get the support they need; this is where SoMoLend steps in! </p></body></html>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0018/9946/189946v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0018/9946/189946v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0018/9946/189946v1-max-450x450.png,5,,377,/company/somonic-solutions,Somonic Solutions,http://somonic.com,hardware,,operating,DEU,,Dresden,Dresden,1,11/1/12, 2012-11 ,2012-Q4,2012,9/16/13,9/16/13,,"<html><body><p>Somonic Solutions GmbH, a Dresden, Germany-based developer of process measuring instrument for electroplating technology.</p></body></html>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0032/7444/327444v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0032/7444/327444v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0032/7444/327444v1-max-450x450.png, ,,378,/company/soms-technologies,SOMS Technologies,http://www.microgreenfilter.com,cleantech,"500,000",operating,USA,NY,New York,Valhalla,2,,,,,6/13/08,12/3/08,,"<html><body><p>SOMS Technologies produces the MicroGreen Engine Filter.

After many experiments in the last months weâ€™ve been able to DOUBLE the attendance by developing: 
Crowdsourced booking process: fans vote which band plays. 
Attendance prediction: We analyze voters and other data to help the organizer book the right band. 
Benefits list: Fans can access to benefits if they register to the list through a Facebook account and share the event. 
Check-in: Attendees are checked-in through a mobile app when entering the show. This makes possible to generate analytics about how many people attracted each band, among other analytics. 
Benefit validation: A mobile app is used to validate the people that has benefits.</p>

<p>The goal of Sookbox is to empower users to enjoy their media on whatever device they choose, from the palm of their hand. At Sookbox, media access is organized by user, rather than by device or service.</p>
<p>Devices should do what they are best at doing. Movies should be watched on a television, not a laptop. Music should be listened to through an amp and speakers, not computer speakers. And the remote control for everything should be a smartphone or tablet. The problem is that communication between these media outlets is difficult and onerous.</p>
<p>Sookbox gives a cross-platform universal solution that goes beyond putting a smart app on a smart TV. Sookbox breaks from traditional thinking in two crucial ways: First is to put a cloud into homes, and the second is to serve content and controls separately.</p>
<p>Sookbox provides a novel type of cloud service. The Sookbox uses stored or streamed content. It allows users to have their own physical server in their homes. This server, the Sookbox, allows a user to store content in their own â€œpersonal cloud.â€ù That is music, digital movies, and pictures on a single server. This idea is not unique, but it is powerfully packaged: media storage, distribution, and control - all centralized and layered in a single device. That gives you the power to use your iPhone to click â€œGoodfellas. Basement TV.â€ù</p>
<p>The core of the product line, the software of the cloud server, is a revolutionary type of web application development platform known as Harmony.  The current paradigm is a world where content and controls are in the same place. For example, the YouTube video controls are right next to the video and the back button is across the browser. Sookbox transcends that paradigm. Televisions are best for video, speakers are best for sound, and handheld devices are best for control. Now that Sookbox divides the cloud by user, it makes sense to serve multiple, different sites from a single web app.</p>
<p>A fundamental Sookbox feature is that it does not compete with other cloud services or try to debunk them. Instead, it gives them a platform and a vessel to reach their current users in a friendlier, more powerful way. Harmony unleashes applications such as Pandora, Netflix and YouTube across a userâ€™s home. For example, someone might want to develop a â€œPandora Alarm Clockâ€ù app. The API allows developers to provide a single, connective user experience synchronized across multiple types of devices. On the developersâ€™ side, the Harmony libraries and structure allow them to serve independently content to content device(s) and controls to controlling device(s). By facilitating this two-way communication, Sookbox allows the navigation of media, the play/pause, volume, etc. to be displayed graphically on the handheld device and directly control the music coming out of the speakers.</p>
<p>Sookbox can be viewed as a personal cloud. Personal meaning the user owns it personally, but also it is personalized. The cloud should be divided by user, not by device or by service. Sookbox opens a new layer between the other cloud services and the user that makes the experience personal and meaningful.</p></body></html>","connective-computing, video, music, controls, content, cloud, networking",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0019/9046/199046v4-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0019/9046/199046v4-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0019/9046/199046v4-max-450x450.jpg,7,42.3736158,-71.1097335427,/company/sooligan,Sooligan,http://www.Sooligan.com,web,"15,000",operating,USA,CA,SF Bay,Berkeley,2,1/1/12, 2012-01 ,2012-Q1,2012,11/8/12,12/14/12,6/1/13,"<html><body><p>Smart students, smart cities.

<p>Todayâ€™s internet users solve problems, develop skills and educate themselves through reading, researching, or watching videos on YouTube and other how-to type websites. Unfortunately for these users, the internet is filled with generic answers for generic questions.

<p>By catering to three unique user-typesÃ¢â‚¬â€ùreporter, expert and PR proÃ¢â‚¬â€ùSourceYourCity seeks to create a better experience for both the report and expert/PR user than current competitors provide. This is accomplished by delivering relevant opportunities to experts based on both topic and location, while giving reporters access to a targeted professional community that delivers better source referrals in a manageable volume.</p>
<p>SourceYourCity is led by Founder, President Neely Burks.</p>

BoomTimeâ€™s initial services include robust Instant Gift Certificate functionality, Dynamic Websites, and an Appointment Request feature.</p>
<p>Service-based companies have been traditionally under-served on the Internet, since itâ€™s difficult to â€œbuy a massageâ€ùÂù over the Internet.  Given that the service-based sector is the largest sector in the US and world economies, and general public acceptance of the Internet for business transactions has steadily increased over the years, SpaBoom is well positioned for growth.</p>
<p>SpaBoom is one of several brands the company uses to reach niche markets. The other brands are <a href=""www.coverboom.com"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""CoverBoom"">CoverBoom</a> and <a href=""www.boomtime.com"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""BoomTime"">BoomTime</a>, for restaurants and the horizontal market, respectively.</p>
<p>SpaBoom first tested the concept of Instant Gift Certificates with spas and salons, due to the perceived importance of gift certificates (up to 30% of their business) and Internet leads to these organizations. It was discovered that almost one-half of gift certificate purchasers wait to buy until the last 48 hours of a holiday or event. Providing an instant gift capability has allowed SpaBoom customers to greatly increase their sales by catering to the last-minute purchaser, where the delays associated with manual fulfillment and/or postal mail is nonexistent.</p>
<p>In 2006, SpaBoom started work on a distribution model, that enables it to sell the Instant Gift Certificates of its clients and push the inventory of Instant Gift Certificates to other distribution networks. SpaEmergency (www.spaemergency.com) was formed in 2006 to sell Spa and Salon Instant Gift Certificates, and a strategic relationship with Zagat Survey (www.zagat.com) was formed in 2008 for its CoverBoom clients.</p>
<p>By July, 2008, SpaBoom boasts over 10% of the Spa market with 2,600 spas and salons in North America. It is anticipated that CoverBoom will boast over 1,000 restaurants by the end of 2008.</p></body></html>","gift, gift-certificate, gift-certificates, e-commerce, service, email, web-hosting, dynamic-website",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/0125/20125v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/0125/20125v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/0125/20125v1-max-450x450.png,12,35.086388,-106.646185526,/company/space-adventures,Space Adventures,http://www.spaceadventures.com,travel,,operating,USA,VA,Washington DC,Vienna,1,1/1/98, 1998-01 ,1998-Q1,1998,10/1/08,10/1/08,1/1/97,"<html><body><p>Space Adventures is an aerospace company that is focused on space tourism.

It is developing the partially reusable launch vehicles Falcon 1 and Falcon 9. Originally based in El Segundo, SpaceX now operates out of Hawthorne, California, USA.</p>
<p>SpaceX was founded in June 2002 by Musk who had invested $100 million of his own money in the company as of March 2006. In January 2005, SpaceX bought a 10% stake in Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.</p>
<p>SpaceX had 160 employees in November 2005, and more than 500 by July 2008. The launch crew in the Marshall Islands has 25 people, 6 in mission control. This small number, compared to similar space launch companies, is part of cost reduction. Musk sees other space-launch servicesâ€™ high prices as supporting unnecessary bureaucracy. Heâ€™s stated that one of his goals is to improve the cost and reliability of access to space by a factor of ten.</p>
<p>Elon Musk stated after the failure of the third Falcon 1 flight attempt, â€œAs a precautionary measure to guard against the possibility of flight 3 not reaching orbit, SpaceX recently accepted a significant investment. Combined with our existing cash reserves, that ensures we will have more than sufficient funding on hand to continue launching Falcon 1 and develop Falcon 9 and Dragonâ€ù; on August 4, SpaceX released further details; they had accepted a USD$20 million equity investment from the Founderâ€™s Fund.</p>
<p>Founded in 2002, the SpaceX team now numbers over 500, located primarily in Hawthorne, California, with four additional locations: SpaceXâ€™s Texas Test Facility in McGregor near Waco; offices in Washington DC; and launch facilities at Cape Canaveral, Florida, and the Marshall Islands in the Central Pacific.</p></body></html>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0008/0305/80305v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0008/0305/80305v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0008/0305/80305v1-max-450x450.png,1746,,530,/company/space-monkey,Space Monkey,http://spacemonkey.com,network_hosting,"2,250,000",operating,USA,UT,Salt Lake City,Midvale,1,7/1/11, 2011-07 ,2011-Q3,2011,7/12/12,7/12/12,4/1/13,"<html><body><p>Space Monkey is an affordable subscription-based data storage solution that is taking the cloud out of the datacenter, creating a faster and more durable way to store data from any device.

Sparkbrowser is currently in the development stage, and is closed source as far as contributions.  In late 2010 Sparkbrowser has merged with Spark Software Group, as well as Free Software Group to combine efforts to launch the browser in August.  As there is an exteremely untapped market as far as browsers go, Sparkbrowser is a pioneer in its respective field.  Making leaps ahead of the competition as the only marketed For Profit premium web browser.  </p>
<p>Sparkbrowser was founded under the principles set forth by the Netscape project, that software should be paid for. And that generally, for profit software is better quality as there are greater resources available, and more attention can be paid to detail.  </p>
<p>Sparkbrowser has met many challenges over the past several months, however in anticipation of the launch in mid August we would like to apologize for the wait as this browser was expected to launch in march.  </p>
<p>We can honestly say that it has been worth the wait!<br/>
The new browser is faster, and provides a preferred view of the web with new pre-fetching code to ignite speed and agility.  As well as a redesigned SSL encryption script.  </p>

<p>In 2013, we as leaders are making business decisions the same old way: we gather input from trusted advisors and make the call. We fail to systematically capture employee feedback, even if we value it, because it is a manual process and itâ€™s time consuming. We are missing great ideas and creativity from our best staff at all levels of the organization, especially the ones that arenâ€™t brave enough to proactively approach us. Systemic issues in the business remain unsolved, crucial market opportunities are not brought to light, and most employees have a transactional relationship with the company - input work hours, output a salary - with varying degrees of loyalty. For too many of our staff, they donâ€™t get the satisfaction of seeing their ideas come to fruition, which results in a missing emotional connection to the company and itâ€™s mission.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s not just a problem, itâ€™s an epidemic. Only 13% of global employees are engaged at work. Why? Because we havenâ€™t found a way to truly engage them. Surveys and all-hands meetings donâ€™t cut it. The talent within an organization is its most valuable asset, but only if they are personally invested in the companyâ€™s success. Worldwide R&amp;D spending in 2011 reached $603B, and yet only $720M was invested in employee engagement. 21st century companies will be defined by how well they optimize and automate their operations, especially when it comes to innovating. Which begs the question: How many untapped product ideas and market opportunities are consuming the thoughts (but not the words or actions) of a modern day employee?</p>
<p>SpeakUp gives every member of a company the power to post a problem, propose a solution to an existing problem, or simply share a great idea. Via the dashboard, leaders are presented with the teamâ€™s top solutions and ideas and can transparently â€œapprove,â€ù â€œamend,â€ù or â€œdenyâ€ù posts. Employees can see that their input is influencing company decisions, and leaders benefit from the ideas and problem solving skills from those that know the company best: their employees. The positive feedback loop that results from leaders implementing employee ideas means more engaged teams and improved products and processes.</p></body></html>","human-resource-automation, b2b, saas, human-resources",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0038/2672/382672v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0038/2672/382672v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0038/2672/382672v2-max-450x450.png,4,,608,/company/speakworks,SpeakWorks,http://speakworks.com,analytics,"624,999",operating,USA,UT,Salt Lake City,Orem,2,1/1/11, 2011-01 ,2011-Q1,2011,7/16/12,10/8/13,,"<html><body><p>SpeakWorks, Inc. develops a video coaching and feedback system for educational and professional organizations.

<p>Dynamic Pricing
This is the most innovative way to buy online where everyone wins! The unique Spinzo platform allows merchants to dynamically price their offerings based on the number of people interested in buying. Every time someone joins a Spinzo deal, the price drops for everyoneâ€_ yes everyone! Gone are the days where you paid too much money for a product, only to see it go on sale the next day. With Spinzo, pricing is fair for both merchants and consumers. Our promotions are also viral.</p>
<p>Did you say â€œViralâ€ù?
Yes we did, and we mean it. With Dynamic Pricing, consumers are compelled to share with friends, because the more people that join a deal, the bigger the savings for everyone! This is truly a social buying experience where more is better.</p>
<p>Unique Offers
Some websites showcase typical products and services with nothing exciting or original. At Spinzo, weâ€™re focused on delivering unique and exclusive offers. How do we do it? Our Dynamic Proving model gives merchants the ability to provide something unique that wouldnâ€™t have otherwise been possible with traditional pricing methods. Think exclusive meals, events, or adventures.</p>
<p>A True Partnership with our Merchants
At Spinzo, weâ€™re innovating on pricing and promotion, but weâ€™ll never sacrifice the importance of a face to face relationship with our merchants. We work with local merchants on an individual basis to craft the best promotional experience possible. For each of our merchant partners, Spinzo builds a â€œcommunity of buyersâ€ù which serves as a merchantâ€™s most loyal group of ambassadors. The â€œcommunity of buyersâ€ù can receive exclusive offers, promoting a sense of loyalty not found in traditional social media.</p>
<p>Join us!
Weâ€™re eager to work with consumers, merchants, and partners as we lead the shift toward a more innovative world of commerce. Weâ€™ve got a great platform, more innovation in the pipeline, and great ideas for the future.

In spite of spending millions of dollars on technologies to help run efficient operations, most companies fell short on generating business intelligence relevant to â€˜theirâ€™ context. This global phenomena took place due to a significant disconnect - Big Data within and outside organizations was being mined, but without the dimensions of a business context.</p>
<p>Spire dreamt what the business world could look like if they could be 10X more efficient. This dream led to the development of a new base platform which could address existing gaps between the data and the context of organizations, and help bridge those gaps with fundamental technologies that generate contextual intelligence for businesses to realize their full potential.</p>
<p>The framework of Spire Technologies centers around Big Data and Context. Context is about critical assumptions and rules that characterize the purpose, situation, and environment of a user holistically. Business context adds value to the Big Data (most importantly to unstructured Big Data) being mined leading to accurate and relevant inferences.</p>
<p>Since 2008, Spire has developed its unique Context Intelligenceâ„¢ Platform with initial application of its technologies in the area of People and Talent management â€“ especially because thereâ€™s a significant and ever growing issue of dealing with unstructured data when one needs to make decisions related to People and Talent.</p>
<p>The essence of this â€˜industry-neutralâ€™ platform is that it can be applied across a plethora of areas â€“ Customer Relationship Management, Market Research, Financial Analysis, Credit Analysis, Fraud Intelligence, Logistics, Healthcare, Travel, Education, Retail, and more.</p>
<p>The SpiroBotÂ® Big Data processing engine and contextual search platform can be applied as efficiently in B2C and C2C models as it has already been proven to provide &gt;9X efficiency in B2B models.</p>
<p>Our vision for the future is to unleash a wave of business transformation solutions that the world has never experienced before.</p>

<p>SPOC is a TechnogenesisÃ¢â€_Â¢ company formed at Stevens Institute of Technology via the office of Institute Technology Initiatives.  SPOC has developed a clinical and technological platform that promises to greatly increase the accuracy with which muscle pain is diagnosed and drive down health care costs associated with chronic pain.  SPOC has set forth to capitalize on an opportunity to work with Dr. Norman Marcus, a leading pain management physician, on developing a medical device to facilitate his revolutionary method for pain diagnosis.</p>
<p>Photo:Muscle Pain Detection Device (MPDD)</p>
<p>Market:</p>
<p>The primary market will be pain management physicians and will then expand to sports medicine, physical therapists, and fitness centers.  There will be a parallel expansion with general practitioners at a different saturation rate due to disparity in the need for pain diagnosis in routine checkups vs. the greater need by pain and physical therapists.  Ideally the SPOC device will be as common as the stethoscope in a physicianÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hand.  Signaling a new era in pain diagnosis where the idea of chronic muscle pain will be virtually nonexistent.</p>
<p>Utilizing November 2003 Bureau of Labor Statistics data an estimate for the potential U.S. market is $1.6 billion and an additional $2 billion globally, for a total potential market of $3.6 billion.</p>
<p>Veterinary medicine is another potential market, but quantitative analysis is pending.</p>
<p>Market Positioning:</p>
<p>SPOC does not compete with current methods of pain diagnosis.  Instead, SPOC will enhance current methods of diagnosis and treatment. Thus, helping realize the full value of current diagnostic tools such as MRI, CT scan, X-ray standard physical examination.</p>
<p>SPOC will compliment the pharmaceutical industry by helping doctors to properly correlate the prescription of pain killers to the correct source of pain.  This may help patients achieve lasting relief by pharmaceutics alone, rather than more drastic procedures such as surgery.</p>
<p>Technology:</p>
<p>SOC incorporates two technologies, one of clinical methodology and one for device technology, for a combined diagnostic package that allows for a revolution in the accuracy and precision of muscle pain diagnosis.  The first is a diagnostic method developed over 50 years by a series of key opinion leaders in pain management.  The contemporary expert in this field is Dr. Marcus whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s patented version of this methodology allows for the diagnosis of muscles in a dynamic, natural, state (as opposed to static).  This simple feature greatly increases the precision of the diagnosis while the unique methodology provides isolation of the pain generator, increasing accuracy.  The device was developed by SPOC and incorporates leading edge technology for trans-cutaneous-electroneural stimulation, a safe, effective and proven way of stimulating muscle.  The patented Dr. Marcus method and the SPOC device are inherently linked, a powerful innovation in the management of chronic pain.</p>
<p>History:</p>
<p>SPOC was conceived at Stevens Institute of Technology as a senior design project in Professor Vikki HazelwoodÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Biomedical Senior Design class during the Fall of 2004.  Building on the initial meeting Dr. Marcus on October 22, 2004, SPOC developed functional prototypes that were delivered in February 2005.  Success of the initial prototypes spurred the current business development relationship between Stevens Institute of Technology ITI, SPOC and Dr. Marcus.</p>
<p>Business Strategy:</p>
<p>SPOC has been developing technology Stevens Institute of Technology over the past 10 months and is currently in a business development relationship with the Office of Institute of Technology Initiatives (ITI) to incubate such the resulting technology.  SPOC is capitalizing on their relationship with NYU physician Dr. Norman Marcus to collaborate and co-develop a medical device.  Additionally the team is capitalizing on Dr. MarcusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relationship with NYU Medical School for the deployment of a preclinical trial to test the device.  All efforts are geared towards full patent litigation and product commercialization within 12 months.</p>
<p>Competition:</p>
<p>SPOC will be the first to market with diagnostic estim.  No other entity has yet to put forth estim for diagnostic purposes.  This is a completely unique claim that allows SPOC to create the market for such application and benefit from an initial void of competition.  Manufacturers of similar technology (TENS manufacturers) may adapt current products in attempts to compete with SPOC. Within 12-18 months of SPOC market launch, there is possibility for significant competition.  SPOC will capitalize on its first to market status and established reputation as the leader in diagnostic estim to weather any competition.</p>
<p>Competitive Advantage:</p>
<p>Competitors will face significant difficulty because they will not have support of a key opinion leader in the field, Dr. Norman Marcus, one of a handful of masters in the unique technique for pain management that SPOC integrates into its technology.  Additionally, SPOC will hold the first intellectual property for the application of diagnostic electro neural stimulation, thus allowing for broad control of this field and first to file on subsequent developments related to diagnostic electro neural stimulation (estim).</p>
<p>SPOC holds intellectual property on the unique claim of estim for diagnosis and a corresponding device.
SPOC and Stevens Institute of Technology ITI have an exclusive relationship with Dr. Norman Marcus to make use of patented methodology.
Dr. Marcus has close relationships with leading pain management physicians.
Dr. Marcus is an invaluable marketing tool because he his willing to use his excellent reputation in medical community to endorse and promote product/methodology.
Investment Strategy:</p>
<p>SPOC is a company formed at Stevens Institute of Technology via the office of Institute of Technology Initiatives (ITI).  ITI is providing support for patent litigation of SPOC technology and support for prototype development.  Once the R&amp;D phase is complete and the project is approved for advancement, SPOC will require an infusion of capital to launch production and marketing of the device.</p>
<p>Current:

$800,000 Bioseed Fund via Connecticut Innovations
Future:

Shifting the effort from organizing to participating, Sportmeets removes the barriers to arranging sport events, while also helping you find suitable people to play with and engage with socially wherever you liveâ€ù</p>
<p>Sportmeets is solving a problem that recreational sport participants face when organizing games and matches - they get overwhelmed by the amount of work required to organize even a single session. Organizers need to spend hours making sure that people turn up, everyone is kept up to date and they get paid for the venue booking afterwards. </p>
<p>It allows any recreational player to organize a group of people with shared sporting interests. Creating an event takes a minute. People get notified instantly and can RSVP via their preferred method - be it SMS, email, Facebook or Twitter. The competitive spirit gets going by recording game results and publishing them to social streams as well as facilitating the organization of ranked sports ladders. All of this saves the organizers and members hours every month.</p>
<p>Sportmeets created a fully-fledged product from scratch and launched it in public including undertaking a complete branding makeover of their initial proposal.

<p>For consumers SportSetter is a personalized fitness concierge service. We match great products / services to you and provide trials of services youâ€™ll love. Select a package and receive up to 4 passes per month. SportSetter works with an updated subscription model where users pay $8.99 or $14.99 a month. Additionally weâ€™ve released the first version of SportSetter Social, which has tripled user adoption by allowing people to follow where their friends are getting fit, â€œgiftâ€ù passes to friends for free, find friends with the same passes, review feedback, plan events, and much more. </p>
<p>The new â€œwant itâ€ù feature allows users to request activities that their friends have tried. â€œThe idea here is to find mutual fitness interests with your friends by discovering what theyâ€™re trying and what they likeâ€ù Co-Founder Niko Karstikko. SportSetter is also a great way for prospective service providers to showcase their product before opening their new facility.  To these prospective service providers we provide a list with a number of customers and their demographics that have clicked â€œwantâ€ù on their business. </p>
<p>For Partners</p>
<p>SportSetter is the first platform built to drive health and wellness product trials to the right consumers and turn these experiences into new business, recommendations and reviews. This exciting new branding opportunity is being utilized by our partners to attract new pre-qualified customers to their facilities with zero effort and no out of pocket costs.</p>
<p>Unlike the daily deal business we provide a continuous stream of pre-qualified leads to our partners. We also have a complete understanding of our members, which enables us to remove all activity pricing from our application. Our partners will never be advertised with 75% off coupons nor will their service ever be devalued like most daily-deal applications. Our users experiencing these new activities know they can afford the service being offered based on their profile submitted at sign-up.  </p>
<p>The company recently engaged in a  â‚¬200,000 project by Tekes, the Finish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation to continue development of our â€œproprietary matching intelligenceâ€ù. Amazon does it for products, Spotify does it for Music, and itâ€™s our mission to provide this to the health and fitness sector. </p>

Helping publishers putting content into context, enabling content producers to get reach and jointly share ad revenues. </p>
<p>The distribution of content today is linear. The publisher is normally both the producer and the distributor with few 3rd party sources of content. This creates a reach and monetization problem due to limited capabilities in producing content and the potential reach of the site and of the content. This problem causes further problems attracting ad spend and that search engines/top tier web sites instead will offer better overview of content, thereby loosing the natural advantage that a publisher has.</p>
<p>Furthermore there is skewness in the marketspace. The online adspend for online video is increasing very fast but is still less than it should be comparing its share of time spent. 
Several reasons</p>
<ul>
<li>Scattered reach (short/long form content of mixed quality)</li>
<li>Immaturity</li>
<li>Very big differences between big and mid/small sized publishers. </li>
<li>Low understanding of how to attract online video viewing</li>
<li>Very low syndication among publishers for both local and global content</li>

They invest their talent in startup companies with high growth potential in exchange for equity.  </p>
<p>Each year, SproutBox will give four hand-picked startups all the expertise, tools, and resources needed to turn their early stage ideas into a revenue-generating reality. During the fast-paced 10-month Sprout cycle, the selected startup (or Sprout) typically receives approximately $250,000 worth of services, along with just enough cash to enable entrepreneurs to stay focused on creating and marketing their product. </p>
<p>The SproutBox approach changes the traditional venture capital model. Traditional VC models ramp up expenses and de-emphasize revenue during early stages Ã¢â‚¬â€ù meaning these companies must find additional funding just to keep their doors open. In contrast, SproutBox focuses on revenue generation from day one. They provide all the development, business, and support services needed to make sure that each startup has minimal recurring expenses, a clear revenue stream, and a marketable product when they leave the SproutBox.  </p></body></html>","venture-capital, seed, investor, sproutbox",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0004/3635/43635v2-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0004/3635/43635v2-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0004/3635/43635v2-max-450x450.jpg,10,39.164287,-86.526904922,/company/sproutel,Sproutel,http://www.sproutel.com,games_video,"278,000",operating,USA,RI,Providence,Providence,2,1/1/12, 2012-01 ,2012-Q1,2012,4/1/12,11/24/12,6/15/12,"<html><body><p>Sproutel helps kids manage chronic conditions through play!

In Brazil, suppliers and manufacturers do not provide product data and do not allow the drop shipping sale. Retailers have to buy products in advance and store in their own inventories, resulting in large costs, lower margins and risks for the small business owner.

Stackdriver Intelligent Monitoring includes several breakthrough features, such as:</p>
<p>â—è Rapid Stack Discovery, which discovers and maps relationships between key system, application, and infrastructure resources within minutes of deployment.</p>
<p>â—è Stack Scanner, an analytics engine that detects transient performance issues, identifies cluster outliers, pinpoints metric anomalies, and predicts capacity constraints.</p>
<p>â—è Elastic Monitoring, which enables customers to monitor dynamic and ephemeral resources (such as those that scale automatically) without manually updating alerting policies and dashboards.</p>
<p>â—è AWS Insights, which correlates AWS events, code deploys, and incidents, identifying performance optimization opportunities.</p>

Using Stackify businesses can easily detect and resolve application problems and ensure their customersâ€™ satisfaction.

Supporting complex business applications requires access and correlating details across multiple sources and tools. Stackifyâ€™s new release provides an unmatched combination of tools that collect application and server related diagnostic data at all levels. It provides an immediate value within seconds of installation which include not only performance monitoring, but also trends, user satisfaction, error rates, and the relations between the servers and applications. This provides a complete picture of a very complex environment.
Agile development makes release cycles shorter than they used to be in the past, forcing developers to be more involved in day-to-day IT operations. However, at the same time it reduces developers ability to get the information they need to resolve issues in their applications. Stackify brings all the relevant information needed for developers and operations to diagnose the issue and effectively resolve it in a secured manner.
There are a lot of tools in the market that provide some of the information, but when an issue occurs it is very hard to pinpoint the problem across multiple tools, servers, and environments.

We want to change this and give people the power to create software on the web focusing on solving problems and building opportunities instead of learning how to code or looking for a developer.
Stamplay is a software creation platform and it has three secret ingredients: 
1) a system of components that perform specialized jobs, 
2) a visual programming language to combine components with tasks, 
3) an editor to create interfaces to interact with the software.
With Stamplay you can save up to 90% in software development costs.

<p>Currently in beta testing until the SEC releases their crowdfund investing regulations (expected Summer 2013) Standoffer is poised to make as big a splash as anyone, offering the most practical solution to finding startups worth investing in among the tens of thousands on the web.</p>
<p>What is Crowdfunding?</p>
<p>Crowdfunding is a form of online fundraising for individuals and startup companies, experiencing rapid growth in route to becoming the webâ€™s fastest growing industry in 2012. To raise money, users post a campaign describing their project goals and plans for raised funds. What investors receive in return for investments is determined by which crowdfunding portal the campaign is posted on. </p>
<p>Worldwide, the most popular type of portal is equity-based, where investors receive equity or shares in startups for funds. The most popular type of portal in the U.S. however is rewards-based, where donors receive kickbacks or â€˜rewardsâ€™ for donations such as products pre-release and/or memorabilia. </p>
<p>History: </p>
<p>The popularity of rewards-based portals was due to investment laws in the United States unintentionally making equity-based crowdfunding in the U.S. illegal. However in April of 2012, the JOBS Act was signed into law by President Obama, legalizing equity-based crowdfund investing whenever the U.S. Securities &amp; Exchange Commission (SEC) released their new regulations for the industry.</p>
<p>The SEC was yet to release the regulations as of March 2013. Despite the delay, tens of thousands of campaigns and nearly 600 crowdfunding portals have gone online, causing many to become virtually invisible among the crowd. </p>
<p>Another surge of portals and campaigns is expected with the release of the SECâ€™s regulations, making the task of finding every startup worth investing in nearly impossible. Luckily for investors, Standoffer.com enables simple and easy navigation among the sea of crowdfunding sites and startups with searches by your own preferences including by location, goals, figures, and more.</p>

You earn points for doing what you already do: reading or sharing a message or post, making a purchase, or answering questions &amp; polls. LykePoints can be redeemed in  various ways for products, services, or donations.</p>
<p>Companies create their LykeBox profile for free.
They then use â€˜LykeManagerâ€™ to:</p>
<p>-setup their points &amp; rewards
-promote their LykeBox presence via the LykeWidget or Lyke Display ads
-get analytics on which social messages and channels are most effective
-create deals, alerts, games, &amp;  polls to further engage their Lykers</p>

(Storm) has developed a revenue engine for location-aware applications and services (LAA) e.g. Foursquare, Gowalla, OpenTable, and Yelp that provides customized discounts to consumers at the right time, in the right place.  </p>
<p>Storm provides LAAs with a solution through its White Label API to LAAs with two revenue-generating mechanisms: 
1)  Pull: LAA consumers choose special offers or certificates to particular restaurants or services
i.  Storm charges the restaurant or service a 20% commission 
2)  Push: a service, e.g. a restaurant, has a slow period and would like more customers immediately. The restaurant uses the Storm API to release a special offer to a subset of profiled LAA users in real-time
i.  Storm charges the restaurant or service a premium to the commission </p>
<p>To enjoy these perks, people become members of Storm.  People can purchase a $15 a year membership with the first certificate or a Ã¢â‚¬Å“PayAsYouGoÃ¢â‚¬Âù membership.  To see how the Ã¢â‚¬Å“PullÃ¢â‚¬Âù product works, visit LetsGoForDinner.com. </p>
<p>The restaurant market is a solid initial target, as restaurants, consumers and LAAs have a series of needs that each group can satisfy: 
a)  Restaurants 
        a.  Need customers on a cost-effective basis
        b.  Do not have the time or skills to undertake social media marketing effectively
b)  Consumers 
        a.  Want to save money but not be embarrassed by use/redemption
        b.  Desire discounts when and where they want them
c)  LAAs 
        a.  Have consumers but are searching for ways to monetize them easily
        b.  Users interact, play or check in primarily at restaurants. </p>
<p>The North American restaurant market is worth $350 billion with one million restaurants, driven by an estimated $14 billion marketing spend. Storm has been able to prove that this is a profitable and growing market through its LetsGoForDinner.com consumer brand.  It generates $34.00 in annual revenue per member with an upfront cost of $9.00.  In a third of the cases this cost is self-funding from the $15.00 annual membership.  </p>
<p>LetsGoForDinner.com is piloting different rollout methods with bloggers and freelancers in order to drive down customer and restaurant acquisition costs. They will be combined with a new iPhone application and immediate digital acquisition solutions to increase revenue. With this model, Storm has a clearly competitive and different value proposition when compared to Restaurant.com, The Entertainment Book and other media (Yellow Pages, newspapers, TV and radio) that restaurants use. </p>
<p>With minimal startup capital, the company has grown its consumer base and still has managed to introduce new products (preload, gift memberships/certificates and iPhone to be launched), acquire new restaurants (now at 30) and customers (4000 signed).</p></body></html>",customised-discounts-for-consumers-when-and-where-they-want-them,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0007/5874/75874v2-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0007/5874/75874v2-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0007/5874/75874v2-max-450x450.jpg,4,,1255,/company/storm-player,Storm Player,,software,"27,247,280",operating,CHN,,Beijing,Beijing,4,,,,,10/1/06,2/1/11,,"<html><body><p>Storm Player is a video player developed by Beijing Storm Technology Co.

* as a co-located dedicated cluster Ã¢â‚¬â€œ giving dedicated capacity and strong SLAs;
* as an on-site dedicated cluster Ã¢â‚¬â€œ allowing you to host the cluster inside your corporate environment.
</code></pre>
<p>StormMQ is sold as a monthly subscription.</p>
<p>As a true next generation messaging system, StormMQ embraces the emerging AMQP standard and has extensive development library support for a host of environments including Java, .NET and PHP on Linux, Windows, Solaris and Mac OS X.</p>
<p>The StormMQ platform is designed from the ground up to scale. The platform is delivered in two formats, as a cloud based service for low volume users, and either a co-located or hosted service for organisations with stringent operational requirements.</p>
<p>Based on a flexible yet power framework, StormMQ is able to quickly scale to meet the needs of a wide variety of architectures and application requirements. The system has been tested thoroughly with leading third party applications such as VMWareâ€™s RabbitMQ, RedHat MRG, and Apache QPid with support for Python and Ruby under development. The platform offers message sizes from 1 byte up to 50Mb to satisfy even the most demanding of applications.</p>
<p>As a cloud based service, StormMQ requires no capital expenditure on hardware or infrastructure and removes the ongoing cost and complexity of managing on-site message queuing servers and applications. To ensure absolute security for sensitive data traffic, StormMQ is the first cloud based messaging platform to utilise 256-bit IPSEC VPN as well as disk level encryption using non-proprietary cryptographic algorithms as standard. Security is further enhanced by StormMQâ€™s Locate-ItÃ¢â€_Â¢ Option for users to own all encrypted disks at the start of a contract to be certain of their disposal. This provides certificates on the location and ownership of hardware throughout any contract.</p>
<p>Alongside our flagship StormMQ platform, we also offer a complete portfolio of value added services including consultancy, technical support and training to help our clients design, operate and support advanced message queuing environments. StormMQâ€™s No-Lock InÃ¢â€_Â¢ Option leverages these services to ensure clients arenâ€™t tied in with one cloud vendor with no exit strategy. </p></body></html>","amqp, mq, message-queuing, software, cloud-computing, managed-service, messaging-as-a-service, software-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service, paas, saas, mqseries, message-queues, middleware, message-orientated-middleware", , , ,7,,1258,/company/stormpath,Stormpath,http://www.stormpath.com,software,"9,700,000",operating,USA,CA,SF Bay,San Mateo,2,,,,,3/19/12,2/19/13,8/8/13,"<html><body><p>Stormpath is a User Management API that reduces development time with instant-on, scalable user infrastructure.

<p>Whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Vinyl, Tapes, CDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, MP3Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s or whatever the future may hold, sharing your own musical tastes and finding out what your friends and favourite celebritiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ views on music has always been at the forefront.</p>
<p>With the advent of social services such as Twitter this has become increasingly frequent and thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a good chance that most of your friends and most probably many other people around the globe, are tweeting about a new song or artist every minute.  Tracking so many tweets and opinions has become almost impossible due to the sheer volume and nature of tweets that individuals mention.  This causes a problem as this means that people are going to overlook really interesting tweets (sometimes even from the artists themselves!).</p>
<p>StudioTweets.com aims to fix this problem by using its own Sentiment Engine to turn Twitter into a fully fledged music critic.  </p>
<p>StudioTweets allows people to view music orientated tweets based upon who they are following as well as the twitter community as a whole.  StudioTweets also lets Users rate an individualÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taste in music.  Furthermore, StudioTweets harnesses Twitter to facilitate reviews and ratings on musical content.</p>
<p>Users only need their existing Twitter login information to sign up.  Each UserÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s profile allows them to view what their friends are saying about music.  The site will also have profiles for Albums and individual songs, containing a Rating, Positive and Negative Tweets (categorised by our sentiment engine), Tweets by friends and much more.  Users will also have the option to purchase an album or individual songs.</p>
<p>Sharing musical interests is also a key aspect of the site, which is why StudioTweets allows users to publish a link to their StudioTweets profile either on somebody elses Twitter Profile or as a status update on their own profile.</p></body></html>","social-media, information-filtering, social-networking, twitter, sharing, social",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0013/7679/137679v2-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0013/7679/137679v2-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0013/7679/137679v2-max-450x450.jpg,2, , 1397,/company/study2gether,Study2gether,http://www.study2gether.es,education,"326,300",operating,ESP,,Majadahonda,Majadahonda (Madrid),1,,,,,4/13/13,4/13/13,,"<html><body><p>Study2gether is an innovative knowledge management platform for schools.

<p>The technology behind StudyTube customizes standardized educational content to fit the unique needs of individual students, thereby, providing the most optimal study plan.</p>
<p>The first product created on the StudyTube platform is an online Study Coach for law students in the Netherlands. Law students can practice old exams on, they get feedback on their wrong answers and during the learning process students can monitor their progress, while StudyTube makes it insightful on which topic a student needs more practice.</p>
<p>Once StudyTube has identified which subjects a student doesnâ€™t fully comprehend, the platform automatically generates learning content, like a video lecture or a written explanation. This cycle will repeat itself until a student has shown sufficient mastery on a subject. In this way StudyTube personalizes the learning process and takes away any insecurities a student might have by determining when a student understands a certain subject. </p>
<p>Out of the 25.000 law students in the Netherlands more then 10.000 students are active users. On top of that, several big publishers, training companies and universities are now using StudyTube to deliver high quality online adaptive courses.  </p></body></html>","adaptive-learning, ed-tech, saas, social-learning, lifelong-learning, online-learning, flipped-classroom",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0028/6626/286626v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0028/6626/286626v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0028/6626/286626v2-max-450x450.png,15,52.3606938,4.8876721405,/company/stuffbuff,StuffBuff,http://www.StuffBuff.com,advertising,"250,000",operating,USA,NY,New York,New York,1,7/30/09, 2009-07 ,2009-Q3,2009,1/1/09,1/1/09,11/15/10,"<html><body><p>StuffBuff is a new king of ad platform allows people to buy and see relevant advertisements based on the text that  they highlight.</p>

<p>We believe that by taking a â€œcreator-to-closetâ€ù approach to fashion that prioritizes quality, sustainability, and the humanity behind clothing, we can change the world for the better. If we can do this while eliminating bloated retail costs for customers, then we can create a win/win opportunity that will forever revolutionize the fashion industry.
By designing non-disposable, core-of-your closet silk and lace essentials, we are returning to the industryâ€™s roots of making things that matter, and things that last.
By selling these collections directly to customers online, weâ€™ve escaped a model that requires excessive markups to offer revolutionary, affordable pricing year-round â€“ because you shouldnâ€™t have to wait for the things you covet to go on sale, and you shouldnâ€™t have to choose between quality and price.</p>
<p>Creator-to-Closet</p>
<p>Our founder and head designer Allison Beal takes an artisanal approach to her creative process. Each piece is designed in-house at StyleSaintâ€™s design studios, manufactured locally in sunny Los Angeles, and shipped directly to you without retail markups. </p>
<p>By focusing on quality over quantity and designing timeless collections that are meant to be worn year-round, we are taking the stance that fashion should be neither â€œfastâ€ù nor disposable.</p>
<p>By partnering with local factories, we are able to create domestic jobs, diminish overseas shipping, and reduce the carbon footprint of our manufacturing process.</p></body></html>","fashion, ecommerce, style, apparel, clothing, luxury, digital-magazine, publishing-tool",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0018/8858/188858v2-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0018/8858/188858v2-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0018/8858/188858v2-max-450x450.jpg,8,,1438,/company/styleseat,StyleSeat,http://www.styleseat.com,social,"14,900,000",operating,USA,CA,SF Bay,San Francisco,3,5/23/11, 2011-05 ,2011-Q2,2011,7/1/11,1/22/14,1/22/14,"<html><body><p>A social network for beauty and wellness professionals to attract clients and grow.</p>

No technical skill is required. The second is a focus on revenue generation â€“ SubHub clients can make money from their content by activating integrated revenue generation features, such as membership/subscription.</p>
<p>Other blogging or website building solutions typically require some technical know-how in order to build a robust site. Furthermore, none feature integrated revenue generation tools â€“ if such tools are available they are typically third-party add-ons, requiring more technical skill to implement.</p>
<p>The SubHub solution is designed for web novices â€“ content owners and creators who may be individuals (authors, journalists, personalities, experts) or small- to mid-sized publishers. For those who are more technically inclined, SubHub also provides tools for taking greater control of oneâ€™s site.</p>
<p>The SubHub solution is fully managed and hosted, making it truly turnkey. Customers pay nothing for a base SubHub website and many of the add-on features, with charges only made for using a domain name or premium functionality. </p>
<p>Over time SubHub intends to provide an increasing range of services to its community of customers, making it easier for them to be successful and enabling SubHub to share in some of the resulting revenues.</p></body></html>","content-management, revenue-generation, web-publishing, cms, subscription, membership, paid-content, website-creation, website-builder",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/2609/22609v6-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/2609/22609v6-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/2609/22609v6-max-450x450.png,10,,1461,/company/subitec,Subitec,http://subitec.com,biotech,"6,291,194",operating,DEU,,Stuttgart,Stuttgart,2,1/1/00, 2000-01 ,2000-Q1,2000,6/14/07,7/16/12,,"<html><body><p>Subitec was founded in 2000 as a spin-off of the Fraunhofer Institute for Interfacial and Biotechnology (IGB).

<p>It empowers the common man to register for free any genuine compliant against a corporation, service or product and seek the best legal representation. With over 1 Million hits in its first month and a steady rate of 800,000 hits each month, SueEasy has resolved a wide variety of legal problems for the North American population. At the same time, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a paid, membership based, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Client Directory For Lawyersâ€_Ã¢â‚¬Âù as described by the Wall Street Journal recently. </p>
<p>Customer Problem: Currently, people seeking good legal help are forced to make confusing online searches, scramble through Yellow Pages, make frantic phone calls or ask somebody for referrals. SueEasy solves this problem by being a â€œ..Matchmaker For Would-Be Plaintiffsâ€ù(ABA Journal Ã¢â‚¬â€œ American Bar Association). </p>
<p>Product/Services: People with legal problems, mainly potential Class Actions can file their case and then VIRALLY spread the user-generated page on 72 of the hottest Social Networks &amp; Bookmarking sites such as Facebook, Digg, MySpace etc. This is consumer activism at a whole new level, giving people the power to fight corporate wrongdoing and keep checks &amp; balances. Complaints received range from deaths resulting from FDA recalled drugs to bad gaskets from a major automobile company to unfair NSF/overdraft charges from certain US. Banks. Interested attorneys contact potential litigants for Class Action, personal injury and 62 other types of cases, thus creating a transparent, streamlined and efficient process. </p>
<p>Market Trends: Lawyers spend roughly $4.5 billion on advertising. Most of that occurs in traditional media, with $1.3 billion going to print ads in Yellow Pages. They have gone the way of the dinosaurs. We feel these are wasted marketing dollars.</p>
<p>Sales/Marketing Strategy: For the litigants, SueEasy aims to be a name synonymous with Ã¢â‚¬Ëœlegal helpÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the first place they turn to. Successful viral marketing (10 YouTube ads created by the founders), PR are already in place using founders contacts; (trade publications, journals, TV &amp; Radio spots planned). </p>
<p>Competitive Advantage: SueEasy is a pioneer in bringing Web 2.0 &amp; litigation together, thus creating massive lead generation for attorneys. Featured on the Wall Street Journal, Fox News, CNN, CNBC, KillerStartups, San Francisco Daily Journal, LA Times, Lawyers USA, American Bar Association Journal, Mountain View Voice, United Press International (syndicated to thousands of news outlets).

<p>However, with an endless number of sources talking about an endless number of subjects, itâ€™s nearly impossible to find the best sources to follow to across your interests.

<p>We built Sulia to address these problems (which were driving us mad too).</p>
<p>Suliaâ€™s subject-based structure of social channels connects trusted sources and enthusiasts on shared interests across thousands of subjects, including breaking news and events. How?</p>
<p>We use a combination of network managers and sophisticated algorithms to identify the best-regarded sources across thousands of subjects. We then dynamically filter content from those sources, regardless of where itâ€™s created (a blog, a social network, a media site, through Suliaâ€™s publishing system, etc.), into high-quality, realtime social channels. The result is streams of timely content from trusted sources that is always on-topic, readable, and relevant.</p>

Where other publications pigeonhole students into stereotypes, SumoSkinny embraces the unique in each college student. College students are not just male or female, an academic or an athlete. They have a wide variety of interests, and SumoSkinny caters to them all.</p>
<p>SumoSkinny created a platform to compile stories straight from the source, written by students for students bringing our readers content on entertainment, news, sports, style, advice and more. Our teams of local Ã_Â»expertsÃ_Â_ (all students) live in their Ã¢â‚¬Å“beatsÃ¢â‚¬Âù, or territories, and are knowledgeable of whatÃ_Â_s in, hot and trending in their area. They independently pitch and write all articles in their locations while working closely with our editorial team to ensure they all have the SumoSkinny Ã¢â‚¬Å“voiceÃ¢â‚¬Âù. Our approach to content has been embraced by our readers as approachable and influential. Our readers associate the mark of SumoSkinny with the very best their college town has to offer, and because of this our readers will stick with us beyond graduation and into their early adult years, continuing to find their news and entertainment on SumoSkinny.com.
Not only are we the go-to place for college students and young professionals, we are the Ã¢â‚¬Å“inside menÃ¢â‚¬Âù for advertisers, aiming to target this highly sought after Generation Y demographic. Every year 4 million graduating high school seniors across the United States join the 14 million sophomores, juniors and seniors at college. Many students choose schools and locations in unfamiliar areas. With some collegiate hubs containing upwards of 100,000 students, it can be daunting for a new student to uncover whatÃ_Â_s going on in and around their new campus, as well as planning a non-academic life and make the most of the college experience.</p>
<p>Due to the immense attractiveness of Generation Y to advertisers, SumoSkinny sells integrated and targeted advertising opportunities across the platform, uniquely tailored to the advertisers requests. The platform, both online and on- campus (with our brand ambassadors), allows many different advertising opportunities including banner ads, advertorials, on-site deals, event sponsorship, video promotions, guerrilla marketing and most importantly geo- targeted newsletter ads. Because we have gained the trust of our users and our content relates to our target demographic, advertisements placed across our platform are significantly more effective and well received by a demographic looking for the next great product, service or brand to become loyal to for the next four years and beyond.</p>
<p>Within the e-magazine industry, there are several online magazines targeting hyper-localized areas, such as patch.com, hercampus.com, thrillist.com, urbandaddy.com, and dailycandy.com all experiencing success, however, these companies each target a narrow demographic, missing entire genders, age groups, communities and more. Today there are no credible e-magazines focusing on the college towns, providing relevant content to both the male and female demographic.</p></body></html>","college, lifestyle, online-magazine",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0015/7523/157523v4-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0015/7523/157523v4-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0015/7523/157523v4-max-450x450.jpg,5,,1510,/company/sumpto,Sumpto,http://www.sumpto.com,social,"425,000",operating,USA,NY,New York,New York,2,7/30/12, 2012-07 ,2012-Q3,2012,3/1/12,10/22/13,1/1/12,"<html><body><p>Sumpto measures the social influence of college students.They provide brands the unique ability to target and engage with specific college influencers.  </p>

Unfortunately, these Class IV patients, despite optimal drug therapy, have persistent symptoms and their options are very limited. Surgical approaches usually involve complex open-heart surgery or heart transplantation.</p>
<p>Sunshine Heartâ€™s C-PulseÂ® Heart Assist System is an innovative approach to assist the heartâ€™s function, not replace it and may be implanted using a minimally invasive approach. The C-Pulse Heart Assist System is designed to treat clinical symptoms associated with Class III and ambulatory Class IV heart failure, sometimes also referred to as moderate and severe failure.  Patients associated with Class III and ambulatory Class IV heart failure are typically unable to engage in normal activities, compromising their quality of life.</p>
<p>The C-Pulse System uses proven balloon counter-pulsation technology to assist the heart by reducing the workload of the left ventricle. During inflation of the balloon, blood flow is increased to the coronary arteries, thereby providing additional oxygen which is vital to a failing heart. During deflation, the workload, or pumping required by the left heart is reduced. The balloon inflation and deflation is synchronized to the patientâ€™s heartbeat, similar to a pacemaker.  </p>
<p>Potential benefits of the technology are relief of shortness of breath, increased physical activity, improved cardiac function, enhanced mobility and improved quality of life. Physicians have commented that patients experience some of these benefits almost immediately after device placement.</p></body></html>", ,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0026/7345/267345v1-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0026/7345/267345v1-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0026/7345/267345v1-max-450x450.jpg, ,44.8666994,-93.44269391567,/company/sunstream-networks,SunStream Networks,http://sunstreamnetworks.com,enterprise,"284,999",operating,USA,CA,SF Bay,Oakland,1,1/1/07, 2007-01 ,2007-Q1,2007,6/7/13,6/7/13,,"<html><body><p>SunStream Networks, LTD. provides cloud services over a fiber optic network to small and medium sized businesses in California.

<p>The Problem</p>
<p>Companies spend billions of dollars each year on training and coaching-in 2006 over $129 billion. However, this training is often ineffective or very expensive or both. </p>
<p>Ineffective-Studies show that after 4 weeks, 85% of what was learned in a classroom setting is forgotten. Additionally, teaching interpersonal and communication skills in a classroom environment is rarely effective. Lastly, scheduling conflicts often cause inefficiency and delay in connecting a person in need of coaching and a coach. </p>
<p>Expensive - Companies spend money on travel, lodging, meals and other related costs in order to get people to training sessions. Companies also deploy e-learning solutions which offer little or no interaction or practice and suffer from miserable completion rates.</p>
<p>Additionally, current market conditions have caused the majority of enterprises to cut training and travel budgets significantly and look for cost effective means to deliver training enterprise-wide.</p>
<p>The Solution</p>
<p>SureSpeak is a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider of web-based video coaching platform and tools. Executive coaches &amp; enterprises use SureSpeak to improve sales, presentation and communication skills leading to enhanced revenues, higher customer retention and improved operating efficiencies. SureSpeak users watch modeling videos that demonstrate desired performance Ã¢â‚¬â€œ for example Ã¢â‚¬Å“How to close the saleÃ¢â‚¬Âù. Then with just an internet connection and a webcam, the user records their version and self-reviews. Typically the user will re-record multiple times until satisfied (current record to save ratio is 6:1). Practicing or role-playing in a private setting has proven to be very desirable for SureSpeak users as opposed to group role-playing which is embarrassing and counter-productive. When the user is satisfied with his Ã¢â‚¬Å“SureSpeakÃ¢â‚¬Âù he saves, and his coach receives an automatic email alert notifying him that a SureSpeak is waiting for review. The coach then logs in from wherever he may be and whenever he has time. This is a key to the efficiency of SureSpeak. The coach provides feedback in written form, in score format Ã¢â‚¬â€œ based on customizable categories such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“body languageÃ¢â‚¬Âù, Ã¢â‚¬Å“toneÃ¢â‚¬Âù, Ã¢â‚¬Å“enthusiasmÃ¢â‚¬Âù, Ã¢â‚¬Å“message contentÃ¢â‚¬Âù, Ã¢â‚¬Å“sincerityÃ¢â‚¬Âù, etc. The coach also can record a video back to the user. When the coach saves his feedback the system notifies the user that his score SureSpeak has been reviewed, and likewise the user logs in when convenient to review. Additionally, each user can receive feedback from unlimited coaches, peers, managers, etc.</p>
<p>SureSpeakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s patented platform is unique in that it is asynchronous Ã¢â‚¬â€œ meaning the practice and coaching is split up into 3 distinct parts Ã¢â‚¬â€œ practice, coaching/feedback, and review of feedback. These can be done independent of each other without delay and at any time. Most training fails in that no video record is provided and if it is not efficient or readily accessible online and cannot be shared. Synchronous training solutions such as video-conference fail as they still require both parties to be available at the same time.</p></body></html>",video-flash-asp-net--net-coaching-sales-training-elearning-lms-role-play,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/6945/26945v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/6945/26945v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/6945/26945v2-max-450x450.png,8,41.889183,-87.6325191634,/company/surespot,surespot,http://www.surespot.me,mobile,"10,000",operating,,,unknown,,1,7/4/12, 2012-07 ,2012-Q3,2012,7/4/12,7/4/12,2/14/14,"<html><body><p>Fueled by a passion for privacy and dissatisfied with current SMS and OTT messaging apps, Adam and Cherie began to design surespot.

<p>Swank is seeking to revolutionize the way homeowners, designers and construction pros shop for tile, stone, mosaic and hardwood surfaces. </p>
<p>Using its service, Swank promises that customers will â€œspend less time driving, and more time choosingâ€ù.</p>
<p>Through their desktop, mobile website and mobile applications, Swank helps construction professionals discover new and unique surfaces at great values that they would likely not find elsewhere.</p>
<p>Swank sources merchandise from hundreds of vendors, including emerging brands and smaller boutique vendors, as well as larger national brands. </p>
<p>Swank distinguishes itself by offering what they believe to be the worldâ€™s largest centralized selection of affordable surfacing materials. </p>
<p>Swanks platform was developed to provide a shopping experience that delivers entertainment, value and convenience for homeowners and industry pros anytime and anywhere.</p>
<p>Swank hopes to be able to provide its vendors with access to a large and highly engaged consumer audience, creating significant brand exposure and revenue opportunities. Many of their existing vendors are small-to-medium sized businesses and may have difficulty reaching a targeted audience of homeowners, designers and construction pros on a broad scale. Using Swanks platform, their vendors can potentially reach a large and targeted audience while also eliminating wholesale, direct sales and marketing costs for the products they sell through Swanks platform, potentially making Swank an attractive channel for them.</p>
<p>To best serve their customers and vendors, Swank operates a minimal inventory, intermediary drop-ship model where Swank takes customer orders before they purchase inventory from their vendors. As a result, they are able to offer a much larger selection of products to their customers than local flooring or Big box retailers do, while at the same time generating greater sales for their vendors, who are able to match a broader range of their product supply to actual customer demand.</p>
<p>Swanks indicates their customers enjoy the flexibility to purchase home improvement products online with easy product delivery, return guarantee and access to product experts. Swank intends to deliver a reliable and hassle-free experience in an industry known for historically poor customer service. </p>
<p>Swank has been operating in a private beta mode since early February 2014.</p>
<p>Swank intends to launch the Swank website and mobile apps to the general public in March of 2014.

<p>SwingShotâ€™s Cyclopsâ„¢ on-course cameras are high-end HD video cameras mounted atop a 3-foot high shaft with a stainless steel turf spike making it easy to position and record anywhere on the golf course. </p>
<p>Serious golfers know the best way to improve your game is to analyze video of your swing. Most swing analysis videos are recorded on the driving range out of convenience. Yet, golfers know they swing better on the range, where they hit 20 balls in a row with the same club from a perfect lie than they do on the course, where they switch clubs on each shot and hit from the fairway, rough, bunkers, and various lies. </p>
<p>SwingShot is part of the ~$1 billion action video camera market. The largest player is Woodman Labs, which sold nearly $600 million worth of its GoPro cameras and accessories in 2012.  </p>
<p>Every year there are nearly 500 million rounds of golf played by over 27 million golfers each year in the U.S. alone. These figures are nearly doubled when the international market is factored in. The typical avid golfer has disposable income, which they spend on golf.

<p>With their backgrounds in science, engineering, and design, Mert and Yuri took on the challenge of Hospital-Acquired Infections by applying the principles of human-centered design to hand hygiene.</p>
<p>SwipeSense is hand-hygiene 2.0. We provide hospital staff with a portable, trackable hand sanitation device that dispenses alcohol gel with the swipe of a hand, while transmitting usage data wirelessly to our web-based application. This allows both point-of-care sanitation and real-time monitoring of staff hand hygiene rates. Lack of hand sanitation is the biggest driver of hospital-acquired infections, which result in over 100,000 deaths per year as well as $6 billion in additional costs to the healthcare system. The average hospital has a 40 percent hand hygiene compliance rate.</p>
<p>The SwipeSense device attaches to any belt or garment and dispenses a consistent amount of FDA approved alcohol gel with the swipe of a hand. Each device carries a recyclable 40 mL cartridge of gel (enough for an average shift), along with embedded electronics that record usage data for each healthcare worker. SwipeSense hubs located in the hospital receive this data and transmit it to our web- based application, which allows for real-time benchmarking and transparency.</p>
<p>This solution results in a reduction in costs and preventable deaths for hospitals. We bring transparency and accountability to hand hygiene, driving behavior change and lowering infection rates. With Medicare and large payers pulling back on reimbursement for expensive hospital-acquired infections, the market is ready for a solution that makes cleaning your hands as easy as wiping them on your pants, while providing real-time access to data in order to improve hand hygiene performance.</p></body></html>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0029/2714/292714v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0029/2714/292714v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0029/2714/292714v1-max-450x450.png, ,42.0460192,-87.6800361763,/company/swipp,Swipp,http://www.swipp.com,social,"9,001,000",operating,USA,CA,SF Bay,Mountain View,4,4/12/11, 2011-04 ,2011-Q2,2011,5/23/12,4/22/13,4/22/13,"<html><body><p>Swipp, Inc., a Palo Alto, CA-based start up that is preparing to release a new social-media platform.

<p>As of April 2009, Swoopo auctioned over 10,000 products per month and had more than 1,200,000 registered customers.</p>
<p>How it works: online customers buy Ã¢â‚¬Å“bidsÃ¢â‚¬Âù in advance. They cost $0.75 each and are sold in packs of 30, 50, 100, 300 or 700. Bidders have the choice of placing single bids, or, using an electronic bid assistant called the Ã¢â‚¬Å“BidButlerÃ¢â‚¬Âù. Alternatively, customers can bid via the phone.
Every bid placed, increases the price of the product by 15c and the auction countdown by up to 20 seconds. To help keep track of the money spent on bidding, each auction displays the amount spent on bids by the customer and how much the bidder would save overall, if they won the auction at that moment.
The Ã¢â‚¬Ëœlast bidder standingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ when the countdown reaches zero, wins the auction Ã¢â‚¬â€œ usually at a very low price; winners save, on average, 65% when compared to the recommended retail price.</p></body></html>","auction, bid, shopping",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0004/0280/40280v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0004/0280/40280v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0004/0280/40280v1-max-450x450.png,0,,1780,/company/sword-plough,Sword & Plough,http://www.swordandplough.com,,"50,000",operating,,,unknown,,1,,,,,10/30/13,10/30/13,,"<html><body><p>Sword &amp; Plough has been in the making since its founders, Emily and Betsy Nunez, were born at West Point into a military family.

Symbolic IOâ€™s transparent approach can be applied to any environment in a non-disruptive way and is guaranteed to effect the entire compute stack breaking down the previously conceived limitations of compute, storage and networking. Symbolic IOâ€™s natural method for addressing how information is stored transcends the constraints of physics and dimension, delivering improvements in capacity, scalability, performance, and security once considered unimaginable. Symbolic IOâ€™s technology is not an evolutionary step forward that addresses a single area of the compute stack, but a revolutionary change that will effect everything technology does moving forward. </p>
<p>Symbolic IO was founded by Hewlett-Packardâ€™s former Storage CTO Brian Ignomirello who has helped shape the storage industry for the past 25 years. Prior to HP, Brian held leadership engineering positions at both EMC in the early days, and NetApp during itâ€™s development of Unified Storage. Mr. Ignomirelloâ€™s development engineering team contains some of the brightest mathematicians and physicists on the planet. </p>
<p>Founded in early 2012, Symbolic IO remains in stealth mode after securing $6.5mm in Seed Funding to date.

<p>By avoiding the unnecessary time and considerable expense of needlessly utilizing medical care in more acute settings, insurers who have enrollees who use Symptify can potentially realize significant cost savings. Symptify specifically recommends the most appropriate place for the patient to seek care based on their symptoms and what their likely diagnoses are. This way, users arenâ€™t shuffled from place to place before receiving the care they need and their insurers do not have excessive expenditures for those visits.</p>
<p>By partnering with hospitals and other healthcare providers, Symptify gives mobile and web users a way to streamline their care once they are suggested to visit a medical professional. Symptify uses a HIPPA and HLA7 compliant transmission function that allows healthcare partners such as ERs, clinics, imaging centers and specialists to see the userâ€™s history of present complaint and all of those pertinent related symptoms that are queried during the user consultation. The hospital gets to engage and capture patients at the moment they are making an actionable decision to address their symptoms and have been given a possible diagnosis and a description of what they should do next. </p></body></html>","health-search, patient-capture, online-diagnosis, healthcare, medical-search, healthcare-savings, medical-social, symptom-search, patient-marketing, artificial-intelligence, data-algorithm, reduce-cost, insurer-savings, insurance-savings, hospital-revenue",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0036/7143/367143v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0036/7143/367143v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0036/7143/367143v1-max-450x450.png, , , 1824,/company/symtavision,Symtavision,http://www.symtavision.com,software,"605,250",operating,DEU,,Braunschweig,Braunschweig,1,1/1/05, 2005-01 ,2005-Q1,2005,4/11/06,4/11/06,,"<html><body><p>Symtavision GmbH provides timing-analysis solutions for processors, control-units, buses, and integration for the automotive and consumer electronics markets.

A link to that photo will then be published in the news stream of those users (just as it does when you are tagged on Facebook directly).</p>

<p>Taggable isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just limited to users with bookmarklets added to their browser. Publishers can also add the feature to their sites.

<p>At the heart of the Taggstar platform lies the ability for publishers to build compelling stories around their online images, layering them with related links and multimedia content which invites readers to engage more deeply with the visual content on a page.</p>
<p>When a publisher adds a â€˜tagâ€™ to an image, a hotspot appears in the desired position which readers can touch or hover over to reveal the relating link or piece of content. Content that might be tagged could include other relevant images, articles or web pages; additionally, the Taggstar platform lets publishers embed relevant video and audio content along with written comments and ideas. All content and links are engaged with inside the image, meaning that site visitors can remain within the article or page they are reading, unless they decide to follow a relating link.</p>

Essentially, it puts the best features of Google Gmail and much more into the most popular email management client used in business today. </p>
<p>Taglocity 2.0 for Outlook enables users to assign unlimited keyword tagsÂù to any MS Outlook items such as email, contacts, calendar entries, etc. This helps create an organizational system better adapted to business use.  For instance, instead of forcing content into conventional folder structures that are far too rigid and often redundant or ambiguous,  each tag essentially acts as a virtual folder, thus reducing the need for folder hierarchies altogether. So instead of making copies of an email to put in several different folders, users can simply set multiple tags on the original message and later, can quickly find that email with dynamic filtering or a simple tag search. </p>
<p>Tags also provide additional context to keyword searches which improves the relevancy of search results.  With Taglocity intelligent search pruning feature, users spend less time wading through huge volumes of keyword generated search results to quickly find what they are looking for.</p>
<p>To help improve organizational efficiency, Taglocity can also automate common tasks by running actions when tags are set, such as turning email into appointments or tasks, assigning additional tags, or simply moving messages into specified folders.  Tags can be automatically assigned to incoming email based on user specified criteria such as who the message is from, or containing certain words in the message body, etc.  </p>
<p>Taglocity tags are either private or public.  Public tags travel with messages to extend the benefit of tagging to others and also round trip so that reply messages come back pre-tagged, even if the other recipients are not Taglocity users. Another time saving feature with Taglocity is tag bundling. Tags that are commonly used together are presented as suggestions so that multiple tags can be assigned with a single click or keystroke.</p>
<p>Taglocity 2.0 for Outlook also delivers another popular Gmail feature to Outlook: proper conversation viewing. A single mouse click brings up all related emails in a single viewer in chronological order similar to a blog. Attachment handling with Taglocity 2.0 for Outlook is more contact-centric than before, and attachments are also much easier to find.</p>
<p>Taglocity Groups
Taglocity Groups is an online (or intranet-based) secure repository where email can be posted for others to see and collaborate on  (think del.icio.us but for your teams email).</p>
<p>Taglocity Groups serves two main purposes:  minimize email overload by significantly reducing inbox bloating office spam (Reply All abuse and needless CCs); and reveal and share valuable business information which is typically locked up on the desktops of authors and original recipients. Group members voluntarily publish email to their Taglocity Groups with any email client, and can then access shared group emails from any Web browser or directly with Taglocity 2.0 for Outlook. To join the free public Taglocity Groups beta, visit https://groups.taglocity.com/Login/CreateAccount.aspx.  </p>
<p>Also soon to come, a Taglocity client that works with Gmail/Yahoo and Live/Hotmail.</p>
<p>To sum it up, Taglocity 2.0 is an Enterprise Web 2.0 inspired email productivity and knowledge sharig solution for enterprises. It really is simple-to-use yet very powerful - and its enthusiastically adopted by users because it provides personal value and works within an environment they already use every day.</p></body></html>","email-productivity, email-overload, knowledge-sharing, knowledge-harvest, enterprise2-0",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/4808/24808v4-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/4808/24808v4-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/4808/24808v4-max-450x450.png, ,49.2812342,-123.10433952023,/company/positivefeedback,TagMan,http://www.tagman.com,advertising,"13,550,000",acquired,GBR,,London,London,4,11/1/07, 2007-11 ,2007-Q4,2007,2/15/10,8/22/13,, , , , , , , , 2024,/company/tagmore-solutions,Tagmore Solutions,http://www.tagmore.com,mobile,"388,500",operating,ESP,,Madrid,Madrid,1,9/1/07, 2007-09 ,2007-Q3,2007,5/1/08,5/1/08,,"<html><body><p>Tagmore Solutions is a mobile marketing technology company, with complete platforms on mobile electronic ticketing, couponing and smart shopping solutions.</p></body></html>","mobile, rfid, nfc, qrcode, aztec, datamatrix, iphone",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0005/0302/50302v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0005/0302/50302v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0005/0302/50302v2-max-450x450.png,15,40.4226918,-3.68830742025,/company/tagoo,Tagoo,http://tagoo.ru,search,"1,030,000",operating,RUS,,Moscow,Moscow,2,12/25/07, 2007-12 ,2007-Q4,2007,1/17/08,7/9/08,,"<html><body><p>Tagoo is a media search engine, with over 15 million songs, 10 million videos and 3 million software indexed.

<p>Tailgateâ„¢ technology turns any online advertising unit into a direct point of sale by providing a clever bridge between the ad unit and the brand ownerâ€™s own e-commerce system. The companyâ€™s mission is to change the way consumers interact with and buy services and products from advertisers, enabling advertisers to close the gap between marketing and sales.  Advertisers can benefit from 15 per cent customer interaction rates with a 1â€“3 per cent conversion rate, while site owners benefit from higher visitor retention rates as the consumer doesnâ€™t have to leave the site he or she is browsing in order to make a purchase.</p>
<p>Tailgate Technologies is managed by young professionals with a clear vision and understanding of the advertising space. The company was founded by Christopher Autry, its current CEO, a veteran internet industry professional, management consultant and a one time biochemist.</p>
<p>The company has partnered with leading brands such as the major Hollywood Studios, global retailers and third party agencies to promote their respective services and products to potential customers on the Internet.</p>
<p>How it works:</p>
<p>Tailgate treats advertising as a self-contained application. This encompasses the entire electronic commerce value chain into a single unit and appears as a traditional Internet advertising banner, video or widget, but with the capability to perform secure financial transactions using payment gateways.</p>
<p>Tailgateâ„¢, a patent pending technology, utilises standard Internet application platforms such as Flash or Ajax to create a presentation layer for the advertising content and proprietary techniques to securely communicate with the advertiserâ€™s electronic commerce database, as well as with the trusted payment gateway in use. The units provide 256-bit SSL security protocols in conjunction with numerous proprietary encryption protocols for each transaction, to guarantee the userâ€™s security and privacy. User information is never stored or held and is deleted in 90 seconds if the information is not processed by the receiving e-commerce provider. The security framework is fully PCI compliant and meets all international security standards. Additionally, California-based Verisign secures the secure socket layer connection from the units to the main e-commerce Web server and payment gateway used.</p></body></html>","advertising, online-advertising, ecommerce, e-commerce, marketing",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/6470/26470v2-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/6470/26470v2-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0002/6470/26470v2-max-450x450.png,17,51.511889,-0.1277432041,/company/tailored,Tailored,http://tailored.co,,"500,000",operating,USA,CA,SF Bay,Mountain View,2,1/1/11, 2011-01 ,2011-Q1,2011,10/13/11,2/1/12,5/1/11,"<html><body><p>Find your bridal style with Tailored.
