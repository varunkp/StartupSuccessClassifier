<p>Globally, online video games grossed $66.3 billion in 2012, and revenues are expected to continue to grow. Because these games have complex virtual economies that interact with the real world, fraud is rampant, with 5,000 new viruses aimed at video game account takeover being developed daily in 2012. This fraud has a bottom line impact on game company revenues and has the potential to destroy the game‚Äôs economy, making the game less fun and taking years off the life of the game itself. </p>
<p>The idea for Panopticon Laboratories was born when co-founder Matt Cook, an online banking fraud industry professional and avid video gamer, realized that the fraud experienced by MMOs mirrored the online fraud and account takeover that banks have been working to prevent for years. As he began to research game companies‚Äô responses to this problem, it became clear that they were devoting significant resources to stopping it, but were primarily relying on outdated, inefficient systems that could be easily defeated by fraudsters. Panopticon Labs is adapting the most-current techniques developed for the banking industry as the core of a product suite built for use by online game publishers to detect virtual identity theft and protect their games and customers from fraud.</p>

<p>The app is a travel social network that connects users and provides real time information about venues and events, relative to the users location. All content is user generated and users can find out the most popular, trending or nearby occurrences. </p>
<p>The aim is to provide users with a platform that allows them to discover the best things to see and do upon arriving in a new place. Built with the student ‚Äòbackpacker‚Äô ethos at the forefront, iSpye is building a community of people who believe there are no boundaries, no such thing as too many travel connections and will never say no to a valuable life experience!</p>
<p>The app has been built for iOS and Android devices. Version 1 has three main features, which are as follows: </p>
<p>‚Ä¢ News Feed ‚Äì venues and events are displayed as pins, which are categorised and shown in the users feed in a list format. There are two features of the feed: Discover and Buzz.  Discover displays pins closest to the user and Buzz shows pins that are tending i.e. the most popular pins at any given time, relative to the users location. The popularity of a pin is defined by the community either upping or downing that pin and a trend is started by the first users activity. A user may up or down a pin through either the Discover tab (most likely while attending the pin or the morning after) or the Buzz tab (to contribute to the trend). The purpose of a users activity is to inform the community of their current experience at a venue or event and not, like tripadvisor, to rate the venue or event itself. A user may vote a pin up or down once every 24 hours, so if they return to the venue or event at a later date they may vote again. The aim is to provide the community with an accurate idea of which venues are the best or busiest at any point in time. </p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Mapping ‚Äì users can drop pins to represent venues found or events occurring. Each pin is displayed at its exact location on a map and can be seen by all members of the iSpye community. By clicking on a pin, users can instantly see how many times the pin has been upped and down. The user is able to gather further information by opening the pins page. A page displays statistics (number of ups, number of downs, %age of male voters, %age of female voters and average age of voters), thoughts and IM profiles of recent users who voted on the page. Thoughts are posted by users and describe their experience of the venue. Users looking at the page are able to gain a sense of whether or not they should attend the venue or event simply by looking at the statistics, thoughts and/ or by chatting via IM (next bullet point) to users who are currently at or have previously been to the pin.  </p>
<p>‚Ä¢ Instant Messaging ‚Äì users can communicate with other users of the iSpye community via Instant Messages. Users are displayed according to their location and a user may chat with another user to find out information about their current or past experience(s) of a pin. The best source of information comes from locals and the IM client allows all users to obtain information in real time. The IM tab also has built in search functionality, allowing users to search for users in other cities. The purpose of search is to allow a user to begin gathering information on the city they are about to visit and meet likeminded people prior to their arrival. </p>
<p>iSpye allows users to tap into a global community of travellers and locals to gain an instant insight into the best and busiest places around them. iSpye will officially launch in October 2013.</p>","travel, student, experience, college, adventure, events, tourism, study, community, holiday, vacation, europe, asia, usa, south-america, accommodation, places, free, international, beach, sea, life",http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0027/8771/278771v2-max-150x150.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0027/8771/278771v2-max-250x250.jpg,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0027/8771/278771v2-max-450x450.jpg,3,55.8610399,-4.2540044

<p>SportSetter ‚Äì International Start-Up dubbed ‚ÄúSpotify of Fitness‚Äù from top European financial publication. </p>
<p>What is SportSetter?</p>
<p>For consumers SportSetter is a personalized fitness concierge service. We match great products / services to you and provide trials of services you‚Äôll love. Select a package and receive up to 4 passes per month. SportSetter works with an updated subscription model where users pay $8.99 or $14.99 a month. Additionally we‚Äôve released the first version of SportSetter Social, which has tripled user adoption by allowing people to follow where their friends are getting fit, ‚Äúgift‚Äù passes to friends for free, find friends with the same passes, review feedback, plan events, and much more. </p>
<p>The new ‚Äúwant it‚Äù feature allows users to request activities that their friends have tried. ‚ÄúThe idea here is to find mutual fitness interests with your friends by discovering what they‚Äôre trying and what they like‚Äù Co-Founder Niko Karstikko. SportSetter is also a great way for prospective service providers to showcase their product before opening their new facility.  To these prospective service providers we provide a list with a number of customers and their demographics that have clicked ‚Äúwant‚Äù on their business. </p>
<p>For Partners</p>
<p>SportSetter is the first platform built to drive health and wellness product trials to the right consumers and turn these experiences into new business, recommendations and reviews. This exciting new branding opportunity is being utilized by our partners to attract new pre-qualified customers to their facilities with zero effort and no out of pocket costs.</p>
<p>Unlike the daily deal business we provide a continuous stream of pre-qualified leads to our partners. We also have a complete understanding of our members, which enables us to remove all activity pricing from our application. Our partners will never be advertised with 75% off coupons nor will their service ever be devalued like most daily-deal applications. Our users experiencing these new activities know they can afford the service being offered based on their profile submitted at sign-up.  </p>
<p>The company recently engaged in a  ‚Ç¨200,000 project by Tekes, the Finish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation to continue development of our ‚Äúproprietary matching intelligence‚Äù. Amazon does it for products, Spotify does it for Music, and it‚Äôs our mission to provide this to the health and fitness sector. </p>
<p>SportSetter is live in Helsinki with over 70 Partners and thousands of users. ‚ÄúWe are rapidly acquiring new partnerships everyday in Manhattan and the surrounding boroughs in preparation for our New York City Launch‚Äù  - Co-founder Trevor Ferguson. Future cities will be announced soon. We are cloud, mobile, social, purposeful and fun. What‚Äôs not to like?

BAT unlocks the marketing power of celebrity through research, endorsements and interactive experiences.</p>
<p>Celebrity &amp; Research: Under the Steelbergs leadership, BAT has secured exclusive relationships with over 3750 athletes and celebrities.  As well, BAT‚Äôs research engine tracks real-time consumer affinity metrics for more than 45,000 athletes and celebrities. The research engine is a hallmark of the Steelbergs√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ approach to entrepreneurship; because it applies proprietary, robust technology to a business in order to dramatically increase market adoption and growth.  </p>
<p>Endorsements:  Advertisers use BAT√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s Endorsement Platform to identify, license, and activate the most effective talent for their campaigns. BAT√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s technology makes the process of securing endorsement talent much easier and more cost-efficient for advertisers. Instead of six-month contract negotiations and six-figure budgets, advertisers can activate endorsement campaigns featuring the most effective talent for a given campaign in a matter of days, and for a fraction of the cost.  BAT powers endorsement opportunities across all media including TV, radio, digital, social, and outdoor, to name a few.  Some of BAT√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s advertiser clients include AT&amp;T, Ford, General Motors, InterContinental Hotels, Intuit, McDonalds, Samsung, and Sony.</p>
<p>Interactive Experiences:  In December 2010, Brand Affinity Technologies (BAT) launched Fantapper, a new technology developed exclusively for entertainment and sports fans, based upon fast-growing interest in connecting with celebrities online.  Fantapper populates celebrity and athlete images and stories online with relevant, interactive apps, giving people always-on access to proprietary content, news, YouTube videos, Twitter and Facebook feeds, exclusive celebrity info, and more. More than 700,000 fans have already downloaded Fantapper. Leading web sites, reaching more than 100 million unique users every month √¢‚Ç¨‚Äú also run the Fantapper application.</p>
<p>BAT√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s high-paced growth can be attributed to the merits of BAT√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s technology as well as the Steelbergs√¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢ vision for mutually beneficial, business-accelerating partnerships with some of the most influential media, advertising, and sports companies in the country.

That clean record from dirt to shirt concludes with fabrics that are indistinguishable from cotton, while helping to prevent a cycle of environmental harm.</p>
<p>Founded in Vancouver, British Columbia in 1998 by Jason Finnis and Larisa Harrison, the company was originally a provider of environmentally friendly, ethically produced clothing called Naturally Advanced Technologies. The company quickly grew through strategic partnerships with Canada‚Äôs National Research Council and Alberta Innovates-Technologies Futures to become a leading developer of renewable and environmentally sustainable biomass resources using flax, hemp, and other bast fibers.</p>
<p>CRAiLAR uses a cutting-edge, all-natural enzymatic process to unlock the potential of flax fiber, resulting in a garment that is as soft and durable as cotton, while minimizing the environmental risks associated with its cultivation. This breakthrough has attracted some of the world‚Äôs biggest textile and apparel brands. But the versatility of CRAiLAR Flax means its potential uses extend far beyond fiber applications, standing to impact industrial, energy, medical, and composite material industries as well.</p>",,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0035/9522/359522v1-max-150x150.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0035/9522/359522v1-max-250x250.png,http://api-images.crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0035/9522/359522v1-max-450x450.png,,,

<p>The name Row 44 was actually the brainchild of John. On one occasion, during his many flights as a college student, he had the rather unpleasant experience of sitting in row 44 on an aging DC-10 airplane. What made this particularly memorable for John was the combination of sitting by the lavatories, under the third engine, in a tiny seat amongst other tiny seats. In his view, if the person sitting in a row 44 type of seat can have an enjoyable flight because of inflight entertainment, then Row 44 will be doing a stellar job.</p>
<p>Today, Row 44 is the most widely deployed satellite-based inflight WiFi service, now deployed on more than 450 plans globally.
